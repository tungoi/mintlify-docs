**Start from 90%, Not from Zero**

<Info>
Welcome to the Luklak Resource Library. The templates in this section are designed to give you a massive head start. Instead of building from a blank canvas, you can import a pre-built, best-practice solution and customize it to fit your exact needs.

This tab is for **doing**, not reading. Find a template that solves your problem and deploy it.

## **Choose Your Starting Point**

We offer two ways to explore our gallery. Start with a complete **Industry Solution** for an end-to-end setup, or find a specific **Business Function** to solve a departmental need.
