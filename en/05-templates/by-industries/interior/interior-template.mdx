## The Challenge: A Disconnected Studio

<Warning>
  Interior design studios thrive on creativity, but operational friction can bring projects to a halt. Client data gets lost between the Sales CRM and the design team. Project budgets are disconnected from accounting. Site survey details never make it back to the project managers. This creates chaos and puts client satisfaction at risk.
</Warning>

## The Solution: A Unified Studio OS, Based on the LAIKA Blueprint

<Tip>
  The Luklak Interior Design Studio Template is a complete, end-to-end operating system modeled on the successful LAIKA blueprint. It's not just a project management tool; it's a unified system that connects every department and workflow into a single, seamless flow of value.
</Tip>

This pre-built solution is structured with dedicated `📂 Areas` and `⏹️ Spaces` for every part of your business:

- **Sales & CRM:** Manage your `🧊 Customers` and `🧊 Deals` in a dedicated space.
- **Design & Construction:** A comprehensive area with `Spaces` for `Project Management`, `Interior Design` (with `🧊 Design Package` and `🧊 Floor Plan` objects), and `Site Survey & Construction`.
- **Accounting:** Handle `🧊 Contracts` and `🧊 Invoices` in a connected financial hub.
- **Customer Success:** Manage `🧊 After Care` and `🧊 Tickets` to ensure long-term client happiness.
