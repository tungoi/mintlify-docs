<Info>
  **The Business**: Zenith English is a growing English language center managing the complete student lifecycle, from initial marketing campaigns and admissions to academic management and student support.

  **The Challenge**: As Zenith expanded, its operational data became fragmented across different departments. Marketing couldn't track lead quality, Admissions struggled to coordinate with Finance on tuition, and Academic staff lacked a unified view of a student's journey. This created data silos, manual handoffs, and a disconnected experience for both staff and students. This blueprint was designed to solve that by creating a single, unified system for the entire operation.

## \*\*ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE & WORKSPACES \*\*

<Tip>
  **This is a Scalable Example:** The structure shown here is for demonstration purposes. You can add, remove, or rename any `📂 Area`, `⏹️ Space`, `📋 Function`, or `🧊 Object` to perfectly tailor the system to your company's unique workflow.

  <Tab title="Unified Organization Structure">
    <Info>
      This diagram illustrates the clear hierarchy of functional units and business object types within the system. This format places the Function (the blueprint) directly under the Space (the instance) to clarify their relationship.

    </Info>
    | Scheme Type             | Selected Scheme for Zenith English           | Description & Rationale                                                                                                                                                                               |

    | **Permission Scheme**   | **"Moderate restriction"**                   | **Balances security and collaboration:** Everyone in a Space can see that work exists, but only directly assigned users can view details and make updates, protecting sensitive student data.         |
    | **Notification Scheme** | **"Notify key actions to direct assignees"** | **Reduces notification noise:** Only important events (status changes, @mentions) trigger alerts for directly involved users, helping staff like teachers and counselors focus on actionable updates. |
