<Info>
  **The Business**: Zenith English is a growing English language center managing the complete student lifecycle, from initial marketing campaigns and admissions to academic management and student support.

  **The Challenge**: As Zenith expanded, its operational data became fragmented across different departments. Marketing couldn't track lead quality, Admissions struggled to coordinate with Finance on tuition, and Academic staff lacked a unified view of a student's journey. This created data silos, manual handoffs, and a disconnected experience for both staff and students. This blueprint was designed to solve that by creating a single, unified system for the entire operation.

## \*\*ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE & WORKSPACES \*\*

<Tip>
  **This is a Scalable Example:** The structure shown here is for demonstration purposes. You can add, remove, or rename any `📂 Area`, `⏹️ Space`, `📋 Function`, or `🧊 Object` to perfectly tailor the system to your company's unique workflow.

  <Tab title="Unified Organization Structure">
    <Info>
      This diagram illustrates the clear hierarchy of functional units and business object types within the system. This format places the Function (the blueprint) directly under the Space (the instance) to clarify their relationship.

## **ACCESS & GOVERNANCE**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Tier 1: Business Privilege">
    <Info>
      This is the highest level of permissions, acting as the "entry ticket" to the entire system and defining a user's maximum potential authority.
    </Info>
    | Privilege Level | Assigned to (at Zenith English)                                   | Permission Description                                                                                      |
    | :-------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

    | **Admin**       | Center Director, System Administrator                             | Can configure everything in the system, from Global Settings to user management.                            |
    | **App Manager** | Heads of Departments (e.g., Head of Admissions, Academic Manager) | A specialized role that can design, edit, and manage Functions 📋.                                          |
    | **Member**      | All remaining employees (Counselors, Teachers, Accountants, etc.) | The standard privilege for most users, allowing them to work within the Spaces ⏹️ they are given access to. |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Tier 2: Item Access">
    <Info>
      These principles act as a guide for Administrators when assigning access to the "containers" of work and shared assets.
    </Info>
    | Item Type                  | Permission Principle                                                                                                                             | Rationale & Benefit                                                                                                                              |
    | :------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **📂 Areas**               | - **Admin:** CEO, Center Director<br />- **Manager:** Head of the respective Area<br />- **Member:** The respective department's Group           | Creates a focused work environment for each department, reducing clutter and improving navigation efficiency.                                    |
    | **👥 Groups**              | - **Manager:** Head of the respective department<br />- **Member:** All members of the Group                                                     | Empowers department heads to manage their own team membership, increasing agility and reducing the load on System Admins.                        |
    | **📊Dashboards & Filters** | - **Admin:** The creator, CEO, Center Director<br />- **Manager:** Relevant Heads of Areas<br />- **Member:** Shared-with Groups or individuals  | Ensures that aggregated data and sensitive business metrics are shared only with the intended audience.                                          |
    | **📋 Functions**           | - **Admin:** System Administrator, CEO, Center Director<br />- **Manager:** Users with `App Manager` privilege<br />- **Member:** Most employees | Tightly governs core business processes while allowing department heads the flexibility to refine them and enabling all employees to apply them. |
    | **⏹️ Spaces**              | - **Admin:** Team Lead or Manager (e.g., Academic Manager)<br />- **Member:** All invited members                                                | Ensures the person with primary responsibility for a workspace (like class management) has full control over it.                                 |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Tier 3: Permission & Notification Schemes">
    <Info>
      This is the most granular layer of control, defining "who can do what" and "who gets notified about what" for each individual Object within a Space.
    </Info>
    | Scheme Type             | Selected Scheme for Zenith English           | Description & Rationale                                                                                                                                                                               |
    | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Permission Scheme**   | **"Moderate restriction"**                   | **Balances security and collaboration:** Everyone in a Space can see that work exists, but only directly assigned users can view details and make updates, protecting sensitive student data.         |
    | **Notification Scheme** | **"Notify key actions to direct assignees"** | **Reduces notification noise:** Only important events (status changes, @mentions) trigger alerts for directly involved users, helping staff like teachers and counselors focus on actionable updates. |
  </Tab>
