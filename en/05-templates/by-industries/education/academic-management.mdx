<Info>
  **Purpose:** This document defines the **internal** operational logic of the `📋 Function` Academic Management. It details the process from designing a curriculum to completing and archiving a class.
</Info>

## Why This Matters

<Check>
  This `📋 Function` transforms the management of academics from a manual, disconnected effort on spreadsheets into a streamlined, scalable educational production system. Strategically, it ensures consistent teaching quality across the center and optimizes the use of the most critical resource: teachers. For the Academic Management team, it provides a clear overview of class performance and student progress. For teachers, it eliminates chaos by consolidating all information (schedule, class list, curriculum, attendance) into a single place, allowing them to focus fully on teaching.
</Check>

## The Big Picture

<Info>
  Architecturally, this system is designed to be the **coordination center** for all teaching and learning activities. It receives input data from the `📋 Finance` Function (via the `🧊 Enrollment Agreement`) and the `📋 Student Affairs` Function (`🧊 Student Record`) to arrange classes. It operates based on three core `🧊 Objects`: `🧊 Course` (the curriculum framework), `🧊 Class` (the actual class), and `🧊 Teacher Profile` (teacher management records). Its key output is student progress data, which is handed over to the `📋 Student Affairs` Function for after-care and consulting on the next study path.

## OBJECT RELATIONSHIPS

| Relationship Type                     | Connection                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| :------------------------------------ | :-------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Parent-Child**                      | `🧊 Course` → `🧊︎ Class`         | Each `🧊 Course` (curriculum framework) can have multiple `🧊 Classes` (actual classes) opened. This is the core breakdown relationship, allowing the reuse of one curriculum for many different classes.                                           |
| **Object Reference**                  | `🧊 Class` → `🧊 Teacher Profile` | Each `🧊 Class` is assigned to a specific `🧊 Teacher Profile`. This relationship helps manage teaching assignments and calculate teacher workloads.                                                                                                |
| **Object Reference (Cross-Function)** | `🧊 Class` → `🧊 Student Record`  | A `🧊 Class` will link to multiple `🧊 Student Records` (from the Student Affairs Dept.) to form the class list. This is a critical connection point, bringing students into the actual learning environment, consistent with the global data flow. |

## OBJECT TYPES, WORKFLOWS & DATA FIELDS

### 1. 🧊 Course (Standard Object)

- **Process Description**: This is the "parent" object used to define and standardize all curricula at the center. It acts as a **blueprint**, containing all information about objectives, curriculum, duration, and tuition for a course. A `Course` is created once and can be reused to open multiple `Classes`.
- **Example**: The course "IELTS 7.0 Masterclass", course code `AC-001`, defines the IELTS 7.0 output exam preparation program with 36 sessions and a standard tuition fee of 25,000,000 VND.

- **Process Description**: This is the "child" object, an **executable instance** of a `Course`. If a `Course` is a car's blueprint, the `Class` is the actual car on the road. This object manages all daily activities: specific schedules, teacher assignments, student lists, attendance, and direct tracking. This is the main working object for Academic Managers and Teachers.
- **Example**: The class `IELTS7.0-C01` is an instance of the course `AC-001 IELTS 7.0 Masterclass`, starting on September 1, 2025, taught by teacher John Doe, on Monday-Wednesday-Friday evenings.

### 3. 🧊 Teacher Profile (Standard Object)

- **Process Description**: This object acts as a **centralized master data repository** for the entire teaching staff. It is not just a user account, but a complete professional profile, including personal information, skills, certifications, work schedule, salary, and teaching performance. This allows the Academic Manager to assign teachers to classes in the most optimal and scientific way.
- **Example**: Teacher profile for John Doe, code GV-007, specialized in IELTS/TOEFL, currently assigned to 3 classes, and has availability on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.

# How to Assign a Teacher to a New Class
This guide walks through the process of assigning a primary teacher to a class that is currently in the "DRAFT" stage. This action will also automatically sync the schedule to their Google Calendar.

## Section 1: Locate the Draft Class
! Important: You can only assign teachers to classes that are in the "DRAFT" or "RECRUITING" status.

1. Navigate to the "All Classes" Workview.
![Screenshot of the Class List view](path/to/class-list.png)

2. Use the filters to find the class you want to assign a teacher to. Click on it to open the detail view.
* Tip: Filter by Status = "DRAFT" to see all unassigned classes.

## Section 2: Assign the Teacher
1. In the `🧊 Class` detail view, find the **Main Teacher** field in the "Resource Assignment" section.
![Screenshot of the Class detail view with the Main Teacher field highlighted](path/to/class-detail-teacher-field.png)

2. Click on the field and search for the `🧊 Teacher Profile` you wish to assign.
* The list will only show teachers who are currently "ACTIVE".

3. Select the desired teacher from the list.
![Screenshot of the teacher selection dropdown](path/to/teacher-select.png)

4. The system will automatically save the change.
* This will trigger automation **CS-06** to sync the schedule to the teacher's Google Calendar and **AC-02** to create their prep tasks.

    - **`View ⏹️ Space`**: All roles defined above can view the Academic Management Space.
    - **`View & Edit 🧊 Object`**:
      - For `🧊 Class`: Only the `Academic Manager` and the directly assigned `Teacher` can view and edit.
      - For `🧊 Course` and `🧊 Teacher Profile`: Only the `Academic Manager` has create/edit rights. Other roles only have view rights.

    #### General Notification Scheme

    **Approach Used**: Option 2 - Notify Relevant People Only
    All actions performed on an `🧊 Object` will only send notifications to users who are directly assigned to that specific `🧊 Object` (e.g., the Manager in Charge, the assigned Teacher). This adheres to the "reduce notification noise" principle set at the global level.
