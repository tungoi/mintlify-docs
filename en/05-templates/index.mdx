<Info>
Welcome to the Resource Library. The templates in this section are designed to give you a massive head start. Instead of building a new business process from a blank canvas, you can import a pre-built, best-practice solution and customize it to fit your exact needs.

This tab is for **doing**, not reading. Find a template that solves your problem and deploy it to your workspace in a single click.
