## **OBJECT RELATIONSHIP MODEL**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Parent-Child Relationships">
    <Info>
      This creates a strict, hierarchical link where a "child" object is a component of a "parent" object. It is ideal for breaking down a large piece of work into smaller, manageable tasks.
    </Info>
    **Application at ACME Corp:**

    | Parent Object            | Child Object(s)        | Architectural Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
    | :----------------------- | :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `🧊 Onboarding Process`  | `🧊︎ Onboarding Task`  | **Work Breakdown:** An `🧊 Onboarding Process` is a complex procedure. Breaking it down into individual `🧊︎ Onboarding Tasks` (e.g., "Prepare Laptop," "Set up Payroll") allows for clear assignment and tracking of sub-items. |
    | `🧊 Offboarding Process` | `🧊︎ Offboarding Task` | **Work Breakdown:** Similar to onboarding, the offboarding process is broken down into distinct tasks (e.g., "Return Assets," "Revoke System Access") for accountability.                                                        |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Global Connections">
    <Info>
      These are reusable, bidirectional relationship types (e.g., "relates to," "is caused by") managed at the global level. They standardize the _meaning_ of the connection between any two objects in the system.
    </Info>
    **Application at ACME Corp:**

    | Connection Type            | Object A                | A → B Relationship | Object B                 | B → A Relationship |

    | **📂 Areas**               | The **Human Resources Area** is accessible exclusively by the `HR Department` group.                                                                                                                       | This creates a secure boundary, ensuring that all sensitive employee data contained within the HR Spaces is isolated from the rest of the organization. |
    | **📊Dashboards & Filters** | The **HR Overview Dashboard** is shared only with the `HR Department` and `Board of Directors` groups.                                                                                                     | Protects sensitive, aggregated HR metrics while providing leadership with necessary oversight.                                                          |

    | **⏹️ Spaces**              | **Recruitment, Employee Records, Onboarding & Offboarding** are restricted to the `HR Department` group. **HR Requests** is accessible to `All Employees` (to create) and the `HR Department` (to manage). | Provides the HR team with a secure work environment while allowing all employees to access the self-service request portal.                             |

    | Scheme Type             | Selected Scheme for ACME Corp                | Description & Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

    | **Permission Scheme**   | **"Strict Restriction"**                     | Balances security with the need for privacy. In this scheme, users in a Space can see that items exist, but only users who are directly assigned (e.g., Recruiter, Hiring Manager for a specific Candidate) can view the full details and make updates. This is essential for protecting confidential HR data. |
    | **Notification Scheme** | **"Notify key actions to direct assignees"** | Reduces notification noise. Only important events (like status changes or @mentions) trigger alerts, and only for the users directly involved with that specific item. This helps the HR team focus on actionable updates without being overwhelmed.                                                           |
