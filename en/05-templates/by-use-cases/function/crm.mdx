<Info>
  **Purpose**: To structure and manage the entire business-to-business sales lifecycle, from identifying corporate prospects and engaging key contacts to closing complex deals and forecasting revenue.
</Info>

## Why This Matters

<Check>
  **Business Impact**: This `📋 Function` provides a single source of truth for all client and prospect interactions. It streamlines the sales process, improves forecast accuracy, enhances team collaboration, and provides clear visibility into pipeline health and individual performance.
</Check>

## The Big Picture

<Info>
  The B2B CRM function is built around three core entities: Companies, Contacts, and Deals.

  1. **Account Management**: A central repository of all client and prospect organizations (`🧊 Company` object) is maintained. All activities and data points related to an organization are stored here.
  2. **Contact Management**: Key decision-makers and influencers within each `🧊 Company` are managed as `🧊︎ Contact` records, linked to their parent organization.
  3. **Opportunity Pipeline**: Each potential sale is tracked as a `🧊︎ Deal` object, which moves through a structured sales pipeline from initial qualification to final closure. Each `🧊︎ Deal` is linked to a `🧊 Company`.

  This structure allows for a 360-degree view of the customer, ensuring that sales representatives have all the necessary context to manage relationships and close deals effectively.
