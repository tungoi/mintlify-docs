🎯 **Purpose**: To systematically track and manage the entire lifecycle of company assets, from procurement and assignment to maintenance and retirement, using physical QR codes for rapid identification.

💡 **Business Impact**: Provides complete visibility over company property, reduces asset loss, and streamlines maintenance. This function transforms the procure-to-retire lifecycle by integrating with **Procurement**, **Finance**, and **HR** to automate handoffs, ensure financial compliance, and simplify employee onboarding/offboarding.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Business Logic">
    This function provides a centralized system for managing all company-owned physical assets. The process is as follows:

    1. **Procurement Integration**: An approved purchase in the **Procurement** function automatically creates a new **Asset** record here.
    2. **Registration & Labeling**: The IT Admin completes the asset details. The system generates a unique **QR Code URL**. A physical QR label is printed and affixed to the asset. It starts in the 'In Stock' status.
    3. **Assignment**: The IT Admin assigns the **Asset** to an employee, which can be done instantly by scanning the QR code and updating the `Assigned To` field.
    4. **Maintenance**: If an asset requires service, any employee can scan its QR code to quickly create a **Maintenance Request**. The **Asset's** status is automatically updated to 'Under Maintenance'.
    5. **Resolution & Handoffs**: Once maintenance is complete, the **Asset** returns to a usable status. If retired or lost, the **Finance** function is automatically notified for depreciation and write-off procedures.

## OBJECT TYPES & WORKFLOWS

### 2.1 🧊 Asset (Standard Object)

- **Process Description**: This object represents a single, trackable piece of company property. It holds all information related to its purchase, value, current user, and condition. Each asset is physically tagged with a QR code that links directly to its record in Luklak.
- **Example**: A "Dell UltraSharp U2723QE Monitor" is approved in Procurement, automatically creating an Asset record. The IT Admin adds its serial number, prints the generated QR code, and sticks it on the back of the monitor.

    #### General Notification Scheme

    **Approach Used**: Option 2 - Notify Relevant People Only
