This guide shows how Luklak makes your daily work easier.

<Note>
  **Your New Command Center: <Icon icon="inbox" iconType="duotone" color="#929292" />The Unified Inbox**

  No more searching. Every task assigned to you, every time you're mentioned, and every important update from all your projects automatically appears in one place: your `Unified Inbox`. Itâ€™s the only place you need to check to know what to do next.

### Understanding Your Work: The `ðŸ§Š Object`

In Luklak, every task, ticket, or item you work on is called an `ðŸ§Š Object`. Think of it as a smart to-do item that contains everything you need to get the job done.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="See All Details at a Glance">
    Every `ðŸ§Š Object` holds all the information: descriptions, due dates, attached files, and any other relevant details. No more asking for clarification.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Update Your Progress Easily">
    As you work, simply change the status of your `ðŸ§Š Object` from `TO DO` to `IN PROGRESS` to `DONE`. Your manager and team are updated automatically.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Communicate Directly on the Work">
    Have a question? Use `Object Chat` right on the `ðŸ§Š Object`. The entire conversation stays with the task, so you never lose context.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Break Down Large Tasks">
    Use `Checklist Items` inside an `ðŸ§Š Object` to break your work into smaller, more manageable steps. It's a simple to-do list just for you.
  </Card>
