As a manager, your primary goal is to empower your team to do their best work. This guide shows you how Luklak provides the tools to build efficient workflows, gain clear visibility into progress, and eliminate the operational friction that slows your team down.

### Your Core Concept: Function Creates Space

Before you can manage any work, you must understand the most important relationship in Luklak: a `üìã Function` creates a `‚èπÔ∏è Space`.

Think of it like this:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="üìã Function = The Blueprint">
    This is the master design for a process, often set up by an architect. It contains all the rules: the workflow, the data fields, and the automations. You typically do not edit the Function itself.
  </Card>
  <Card title="‚èπÔ∏è Space = The Live Workspace">
    This is the actual environment you launch _from_ a Function. It‚Äôs where your team collaborates on `üßä Objects`. As a manager, you own and operate the `‚èπÔ∏è Space`.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Managing Work Within Your `‚èπÔ∏è Space`

Once your `‚èπÔ∏è Space` is live, Luklak gives you a dedicated toolkit to enhance productivity.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Customizable Workflows">
    Take control of your process. Within your `‚èπÔ∏è Space`, you can adjust the `Workflow` by adding or renaming statuses (e.g., `IN REVIEW`, `AWAITING FEEDBACK`, `APPROVED`) to perfectly match how your team operates.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Powerful Workviews">
    Gain visibility from every angle. Create and save different `Workviews` (List, Kanban, Calendar) to track work. Use a Kanban for progress, a Calendar for deadlines, and saved filters to create personal to-do lists for each team member.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Real-Time Dashboards">
    Stop chasing status updates. Build `Dashboards` within your `‚èπÔ∏è Space` to monitor your team's KPIs in real-time. Track metrics like "Overdue `üßä Objects`" or "Tasks Completed This Week" without manual reporting.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Unified Communication">
    Keep conversations in context. Use `Object Chat` for discussions about a specific task and `Space Chat` for team-wide announcements. All communication is tied directly to the work, eliminating confusion from scattered chat apps.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Managing Your Team Effectively

Beyond workflows, Luklak simplifies the administrative side of managing your team.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Onboarding New Members">
    Quickly bring new hires up to speed. Add a new user to your `‚èπÔ∏è Space` in seconds and assign them a `Role` that instantly gives them the correct permissions to see and do their job.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Assigning Work & Balancing Load">
    Ensure clarity and prevent burnout. Assign `üßä Objects` directly to individuals or groups. Use dashboards to visualize team workload, easily identifying who has capacity and who is overloaded.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Setting Clear Permissions">
    Maintain control and security. Use `Permission schemes` and `Roles` to define exactly who can view `üßä Objects`, change their status, or access sensitive information within your `‚èπÔ∏è Space`.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Your First 30 Days as a Manager

Here is a practical roadmap to get you and your team started.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **`1. Launch Your First ‚èπÔ∏è Space`**

    Start by selecting a pre-built `üìã Function` from the template library (e.g., "Team Task Management") and launch it as your team's new `‚èπÔ∏è Space`.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **2. Customize Your Workflow & Invite Your Team**

    Review the default `Workflow` and adjust the statuses to match your team's process. Invite your team members via email and assign them to the "Member" `Role`.
  </Step>
  <Step>
    **3. Build Your First Team Dashboard**

    Create a simple `Dashboard` with two widgets: one listing all `OPEN` `üßä Objects` assigned to the current user, and another showing a pie chart of `üßä Objects` by assignee.
  </Step>
</Steps>
