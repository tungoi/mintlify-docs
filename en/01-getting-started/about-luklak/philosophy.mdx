If you're running a business, you're likely familiar with an expensive reality: "Software Sprawl." Your company pays for a CRM, a project management tool, a customer support system, and dozens of other apps.

<Note>
  In theory, they make you more efficient. In reality, they create invisible walls—data silos, disconnected processes, and operational friction from constant context switching. This is the outdated "app-suite" model, and it's holding back your growth.

      Luklak is not a suite of apps. It's a single, unified foundation for building your own Business Operating System, powered by 9 universal "LEGO" pieces.

    Traditional software vendors sell you a suite of apps that look connected but are separate products bundled together. This leads to a constant "integration tax" in time and money, fragmented workflows, and a lack of a single source of truth. We believe there is a better way.

# Tutorial: Visualizing Your Entire Value Stream
From first contact with a lead to a completed project, see your entire customer journey in a single view.

## Section 1: Connecting the Dots
! Important: This requires the CRM and Project Management Functions to be installed.

1. Navigate to your global Workviews and create a new Dashboard.
![A screenshot showing the creation of a new Dashboard]

2. Add a new widget and select "Object Query" using UQL.

3. Enter the query: "SHOW 'Leads' AND 'Customers' CONNECTED TO 'Projects' WHERE 'Project Status' != 'Completed'".
* Tip: This UQL query pulls data across three different Object types.

## Section 2: Building the Command Center
1. Visualize the results as a Timeline view, grouped by "Project Manager".
![A screenshot of the Timeline view setup]

2. Add another widget showing a chart of "Project Value by Quarter".

3. You now have a real-time dashboard showing your active customer projects, their value, and who is responsible—all from a single screen. This is the power of a unified platform.
