## Key Distinctions at a Glance

This table clarifies some of the most important and commonly confused concepts.

| We Say...                | We Mean...            | Not to be confused with... | The Core Difference                                                                                                 |
| :----------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`üìã Function`**        | The **Blueprint**     | **`‚èπÔ∏è Space`**             | A Function is the design; a Space is the live workspace created from that design.                                   |
| **`Object Type`**        | The **Blueprint**     | **`üßä Object`**            | An Object Type is the template (e.g., "Sales Deal"); an Object is the actual instance (e.g., "The Acme Corp Deal"). |
| **`Workview`**           | The **Workshop**      | **`Dashboard`**            | A Workview is for _executing_ work on individual Objects; a Dashboard is for _analyzing_ aggregated data.           |
| **`Workspace`**          | The **Manager's Hub** | **`‚èπÔ∏è Space`**             | A Space is an official team workspace; a Workspace is a personal dashboard for a manager to _view_ multiple Spaces. |
| **`Business Privilege`** | The **Entry Ticket**  | **`Item Access`**          | Privilege gets you into the system; Item Access gives you the keys to specific things _inside_ the system.          |
