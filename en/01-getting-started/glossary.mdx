**Why This Matters**

<Info>
  Your business doesn't run on apps; it runs on value flows. But today, that value is trapped, frozen between siloed systems never built to speak the same language. Sales captures critical feedback that Design never sees. Innovations die in project management tools before Marketing can launch them. This isn't a tooling problem‚Äîit's a growth problem. Traditional systems create silos, then sell you expensive, fragile "bridges" to connect them. Luklak eliminates the silos altogether. This guide will show you how to build a truly frictionless value flow, turning departmental handoffs into a seamless, automated journey.

**The Scenario: A Customer Journey Without Friction**

Let's walk through a real-world example. A new customer, LAIKA, needs a construction project managed from initial contact to final invoice. In a typical company, this involves a dozen apps, countless emails, and manual data entry. In Luklak, it's one continuous flow.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="1. Marketing ‚Üí Sales">
    **From First Touch to Qualified Deal**

    A `üßä Lead Object` is created in the **Marketing** `‚èπÔ∏è Space` from a web form. Once qualified, a status change to "Sales Ready" automatically triggers the creation of a `üßä Deal Object` and a `üßä Customer Object` in the **Sales** CRM `‚èπÔ∏è Space`. All marketing context is perfectly preserved and linked.

    <Info>
      **Result:** Sales gets a rich, complete view of the new deal instantly. Zero data re-entry, zero lost information.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="2. Sales ‚Üí Design">
    **From "Closed Won" to Concept Kickoff**

    The sales rep changes the `üßä Deal Object` status to "Closed Won." This triggers an automation that creates a main `üßä Project Object` and immediately assigns a `üßäÔ∏é Design Concept Sub-Object` to the **Design** `‚èπÔ∏è Space`. The design team gets all the client requirements from the linked `Deal` and can start work immediately.

    <Info>
      **Result:** The creative process begins the moment a deal is signed, eliminating administrative delays and ensuring designers work from the original source of truth.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="3. Design ‚Üí Project Management">
    **From Approved Design to Project Plan**

    When the `üßäÔ∏é Design Concept` is approved by the client, its status change triggers the next handoff. The main `üßä Project Object` is automatically moved to the "Execution" stage and assigned to the **Project Management** `‚èπÔ∏è Space`. The system auto-populates the project plan with key tasks based on the approved design scope.

    <Info>
      **Result:** Project managers receive a fully-contextualized project ready for execution, complete with approved designs and client history.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="4. PM ‚Üí Operations">
    **From Project Plan to On-Site Tasks**

    The Project Manager breaks down the plan into on-site tasks. An automation assigns these `üßäÔ∏é Site Work Sub-Objects` directly to the **Operations** team's `‚èπÔ∏è Space`. Field workers (`Site workers`) can view and update task status directly from their mobile devices, with progress rolling up to the main `Project Object` in real-time.

    <Info>
      **Result:** Perfect alignment between the central plan and field execution. Management has a live view of on-site progress without chasing updates.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="5. Operations ‚Üí Finance">
    **From Project Completion to Invoicing**

    The moment the final `üßäÔ∏é Site Work` task is marked "Complete" by the Operations team, the main `üßä Project Object` status automatically updates to "Ready for Invoicing." This triggers the creation of an `üßä Invoice Object` in the **Finance** `‚èπÔ∏è Space`, pre-filled with the customer's details and the project's final value.

    <Info>
      **Result:** Invoicing happens the instant a project is finished, dramatically shortening the billing cycle and improving cash flow.
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="6. Finance ‚Üí Customer Service">
    **From Paid Invoice to Ongoing Support**

    When the Finance team marks the `üßä Invoice` as "Paid," the final automation in the chain kicks in. A `üßäÔ∏é Support Contract Object` is created and assigned to the **Customer Service** `‚èπÔ∏è Space`, officially beginning the post-project support and warranty period.

    <Info>
      **Result:** The customer is seamlessly transitioned to the support team with their full project history intact, ensuring a world-class post-sale experience.

**The Logic Behind It: How an Automation Rule is Born**

The seamless handoffs in the LAIKA example aren't custom code; they are simple, powerful rules built on a "Trigger -\> Condition -\> Action" principle. Here‚Äôs how the "Sales to Project Management" automation is constructed logically inside Luklak.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="1. The Trigger (The 'If')" icon="bolt" iconType="duotone">
    Every automation begins with a **Trigger**‚Äîa specific event that Luklak listens for. In our example, the trigger is: 'When an Object is updated'. Specifically, when the 'Status' field of any `üßä Deal Object` changes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. The Condition (The 'Only When')" icon="filter" iconType="duotone">
    The **Condition** adds precision, ensuring the automation only runs when certain criteria are met. Here, the condition is: 'The new status is Closed Won'. This prevents the rule from firing for any other status change.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. The Action (The 'Then')" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" iconType="duotone">
    The **Action** is what the automation does. The action here is complex, but declarative: 'Create a new `üßä Project Object` in the Project Management `‚èπÔ∏è Space`, and populate its fields with data from the trigger `üßä Deal Object`.'
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  This **"Trigger -\> Condition -\> Action"** model is universal across the platform. By defining these three simple parts, you can construct sophisticated, cross-functional workflows that perfectly mirror your business processes without writing a single line of code.
</Tip>

**The Universal Secret: How This Is All Possible**

This seamless flow isn't magic‚Äîit's a fundamental architectural advantage. Traditional software creates disconnected "islands" of data and then relies on fragile, third-party "bridges" (integrations) to connect them. Luklak is built on a unified foundation from the ground up.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="The Universal Object" icon="cube" iconType="duotone">
    Everything in Luklak‚Äîa sales lead, a project task, a customer invoice‚Äîis a version of the same foundational LEGO piece: the `üßä Object`. This shared DNA means every department's data speaks the same native language.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Object Connection" icon="link" iconType="duotone">
    Because everything is an `üßä Object`, any `Object` can be natively linked to any other. There's no need to build a 'bridge' between your CRM and your project tool, because the relationship is part of the core platform fabric.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Universal Automation" icon="robot" iconType="duotone">
    This is the platform's central nervous system. It can listen for events and trigger actions on any `üßä Object`, in any `‚èπÔ∏è Space`, across the entire organization. It's not an add-on; it's the engine that drives the unified workflow.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  One system, one language, one logic. The result is zero friction and a truly scalable operating system for your business.
