# Tour: The "Laika" Project
Follow the "Laika Brand Launch" project from creation to completion, showing how different team members collaborate in one unified Space.

## Section 1: The Project Kick-off (Manager's View)
! A manager sets up the new project and defines the core tasks.

1. In the 'Client Projects' `‚èπÔ∏è Space`, a Project Manager creates a new `üßä Object` called "Laika Brand Launch".
![The new Object creation form being filled out for the Laika project.]

2. The manager assigns team members and sets the main status to `IN PROGRESS`. Inside the `üßä Object`, they use `Checklist Items` to list out the key deliverables.
![The main project Object view, showing the assigned team members and a checklist with items like 'Design Logo' and 'Write Ad Copy'.]

## Section 2: The Creative Team at Work (Team's View)
! Team members collaborate on their tasks within the same `üßä Object`.

1. The Designer sees the 'Design Logo' task in their `Unified Inbox`. They open the `üßä Object` and start working.
![The Designer's Unified Inbox, with the new task notification highlighted.]

2. The Copywriter needs to align with the Designer. They use `Object Chat` to ask about the logo's visual theme, keeping the conversation attached to the work.

## Section 3: The Approval Workflow (Account Manager's View)
! A task's status change automatically notifies the next person in the workflow.

1. The Designer finishes the logo and updates the 'Design Logo' checklist item status to `PENDING APPROVAL`.
![A close-up on the checklist item, showing its individual status being changed to PENDING APPROPAL.]

2. The Account Manager is automatically notified. They see the logo is ready for client review.
![A system notification pop-up for the Account Manager: "Logo for Laika Brand Launch is ready for approval."]

3. After the client, Laika, says "I love it!" on a call, the Account Manager changes the status to `APPROVED` and checks the task off the list.
![The checklist item now showing a green checkmark next to it, with the status set to APPROVED.]

## Section 4: The Big Picture, Automatically (Manager's View)
! Individual task updates automatically roll up into the overall project's progress.

1. The Project Manager checks their 'All Projects' `Dashboard` at the end of the day.
![A clean dashboard showing multiple projects and their high-level statuses.]

2. The 'Laika Brand Launch' project's completion meter has automatically updated. The manager knows the project is on track without needing a single email or status meeting.

## The Same Power, Any Industry

The principles you just saw can be applied to any type of work. The üßä Object is universal.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="For Software Development">
    Your üßä Object is a 'Feature Epic'. Checklist items become 'Develop API', 'Write Unit Tests', and 'Deploy to Staging'. The status PENDING APPROVAL becomes IN CODE REVIEW.
  </Card>
  <Card title="For Manufacturing">
    Your üßä Object is a 'Production Order'. Checklist items are 'Source Materials', 'Assemble Product', and 'Quality Control'. The Dashboard tracks production yield, not project completion.
  </Card>
  <Card title="For Construction">
    Your üßä Object is a 'Site Milestone'. Checklist items become 'Pour Foundation', 'Install Electrical', and 'Final Inspection'. The Object Chat contains safety logs and inspection photos.
  </Card>
  <Card title="For Logistics">
    Your üßä Object is a 'Shipment'. Checklist items are 'Pack Goods', 'Clear Customs', and 'Final Delivery'. The Dashboard tracks 'On-Time Delivery Rate'.
