Welcome to Luklak\! This guide provides a complete roadmap for setting up your new account for success. Follow these steps to configure your platform, onboard your team, and launch your first live workspace.

<Note>
  **Before You Begin**

  To make this process as smooth as possible, have a think about two things:

  1. One simple, repeatable process in your team you'd like to improve (e.g., managing marketing requests, tracking bugs).
  2. A list of the team members you'll be inviting.
</Note>

### Your Setup Roadmap

This process is broken down into clear, manageable steps. Follow them in order to get your account ready for your team.

<Steps>
  <Step>
    **1. Configure Organization Settings**

    Set your organization's name, logo, and timezone. These simple settings ensure a professional and consistent experience for all your users.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    **2. Create User Groups**

    Set up `Groups` like 'Marketing Team', 'Developers', or 'Sales Team'. Using `Groups` makes it much faster to assign permissions and tasks later on.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    **3. Invite Your Team Members**

    Invite your team members to join your Luklak account. You can add them to the `Groups` you just created during the invitation process for maximum efficiency.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    **4. Launch Your First Workspace**

    Now it's time to create a place for your team to work. You'll do this by launching a `‚èπÔ∏è Space` from a pre-built `üìã Function` template. This is the core of Luklak in action.

  </Step>
  <Step>
    **`5. Configure the ‚èπÔ∏è Space`**

    Assign your team members to the new `‚èπÔ∏è Space` and briefly customize the workflow statuses to match your team's process (e.g., adding an `IN REVIEW` status).

  </Step>
</Steps>

**Congratulations\!** You've successfully set up your account and launched a live workspace. Your team can now start collaborating and managing their work in one unified place.
