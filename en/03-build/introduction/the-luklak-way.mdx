**Why This Matters**

<Info>
  Building powerful business systems can feel chaotic. Without a clear plan, solutions often fail to meet real-world needs, create data messes, or can't adapt to change. "The Luklak Way" is a strategic framework that transforms this chaos into a predictable process.

  By following these steps, you learn to think like an architect. You ensure that what you build is robust, scalable, and perfectly aligned with your business outcomes from day one, saving weeks of rebuilding later.

## **The 8-Step Design Process**

This iterative methodology is the foundation for every successful playbook and custom solution built on Luklak. Master these steps, and you can build anything.

  <Card title="1. Analysis & Scope" icon="magnifying-glass-chart" iconType="duotone">
    Don't jump to building. First, deeply understand the business problem. Interview stakeholders, map the current process, and define clear boundaries for what the solution will (and will not) do.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Define Universal Objects" icon="cubes" iconType="duotone">
    Identify the core "nouns" of your process. Are you tracking `Customers`, `Projects`, `Candidates`, or `Assets`? Define these as `ðŸ§Š Universal Objects` to create your system's data backbone.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Design Workflows & Statuses" icon="arrow-progress" iconType="duotone">
    Map the lifecycle of each Object. How does a `Project` move from `IDEA` to `COMPLETED`? Define the exact stages (statuses) and the rules for transitioning between them to standardize your operation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="4. Configure Data Fields" icon="pen-field" iconType="duotone">
    What specific information do you need to capture for each Object? Now is the time to add the custom fieldsâ€”text, numbers, dates, dropdownsâ€”required to run the process and make decisions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="5. Set Up Universal Automation" icon="robot" iconType="duotone">
    Identify every opportunity to eliminate manual work. Build automations to assign tasks, send notifications, update statuses, and connect processes, freeing your team to focus on high-value work.
  </Card>
  <Card title="6. Create Workviews & Dashboards" icon="table-columns" iconType="duotone">
    Different teams need different views. Design the specific `Workviews` (Lists, Kanbans, Timelines) and Dashboards that give each stakeholder the perfect, real-time perspective on the data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="7. Set Permissions & Roles" icon="user-shield" iconType="duotone">
    Who needs access to what information? Implement a granular permission scheme to ensure data security, protect sensitive information, and guarantee users only see what's relevant to their role.
  </Card>
  <Card title="8. Test, Gather Feedback & Deploy" icon="rocket-launch" iconType="duotone">
    Before a full rollout, test the entire solution with a pilot group of end-users. Gather their feedback, make crucial adjustments, iterate on the design, and then deploy with confidence to the wider organization.
