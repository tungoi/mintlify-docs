<Info>
You've explored the Platform Reference and understand the powerful "Lego pieces" at your disposal. This is where you learn to assemble them. Tab 3 is designed to bridge the gap between theory and practice, guiding you from conceptual knowledge to a fully functional, real-world business solution.

Here, you will not just learn *what* a feature does, but *how* and *why* you should use it in context to solve complex operational challenges.
