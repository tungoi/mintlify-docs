**Why This Matters**

<Info>
A CRM system fails when it's built on assumptions. A powerful tool cannot fix a broken or undefined process. This initial planning phase is the most critical part of the entire playbook. Investing time here to deeply understand your real-world sales process and stakeholder needs will prevent costly redesigns later. 

For a solution builder, this is your blueprinting stage. For a sales manager, this is how you ensure the final system actually helps your team win more deals.

## **Step 1: Map Your Current Sales Process**

Before you can build, you must understand. The first step is to get your entire sales process out of your team's heads and onto a whiteboard or digital canvas. Don't think about Luklak yet; think about your reality.

**Key Questions to Answer:**

- **Lead Generation**: Where do new leads come from? (e.g., Website form, manual entry, imported list, referral?)
- **The Sales Funnel**: What are the exact stages a potential deal moves through from start to finish? Be specific.
  - *Example*: `NEW LEAD` → `CONTACT ATTEMPTED` → `MEETING SCHEDULED` → `PROPOSAL SENT` → `NEGOTIATION` → `CLOSED WON` / `CLOSED LOST`.
- **Stage Gates**: What specific criteria must be met for a deal to move from one stage to the next? (e.g., A deal can't move to `PROPOSAL SENT` until a discovery meeting has been logged).
- **Key Activities**: What are the most common actions your team takes? (e.g., `Log a call`, `Send an email`, `Schedule a demo`).
- **Pain Points**: Where does the current process break down? Where are the bottlenecks, data-entry frustrations, or communication gaps?

## **Step 2: Interview Your Stakeholders**

The best CRM serves everyone involved in the customer lifecycle. You must build for the people who will use the system every day. Sit down with them and understand their world.

- **Sales Representatives**:
  - What are their biggest daily time-wasters?
  - What information do they need instantly when talking to a lead?
  - If they could wave a magic wand, what one repetitive task would they eliminate?
- **Sales Managers**:
  - What metrics are essential for forecasting and team performance tracking?
  - How do they currently monitor the team's pipeline and activity?
  - What does their ideal weekly sales report look like?
- **Leadership**:
  - What single business outcome do they expect from this new CRM? (e.g., "Increase conversion rate by 15%", "Shorten the average sales cycle by 5 days").

## **Step 3: Define Your "Minimum Viable CRM"**

It's tempting to try and build the "perfect" system with every feature imaginable. Resist this urge. The most successful approach is to start with a simple, solid foundation (Version 1.0) and iterate.

Use the MoSCoW method to prioritize:

- **Must-Have**: The absolute non-negotiable features and data points needed to run your core sales process.
  - *Example: The ability to track Contacts, Organizations, and Opportunities with defined stages and values.*
- **Should-Have**: Important features that will add significant value but can wait for the next iteration (V1.1).
  - *Example: Automated follow-up task creation.*
- **Could-Have**: Good ideas that are not critical for launch.
  - *Example: Integration with a marketing email platform.*
- **Won't-Have (This Time)**: Features explicitly ruled out for V1.0 to prevent scope creep.
  - *Example: Custom invoicing directly from the CRM.*

**Your Deliverable for Phase 1**

By the end of this phase, you should have a document that clearly outlines:
1.  A visual diagram of your sales process and its stages.
2.  A list of all the data points (fields) you need to capture.
3.  Your prioritized MoSCoW list defining the scope of V1.0.
