**Why This Matters**

<Info>
Off-the-shelf CRM software forces you into a box. They are often rigid, complex, and disconnected from the rest of your operations. This playbook flips the script. Instead of adapting your sales process to a tool, you will build a CRM that adapts perfectly to your business. By completing this guide, you won't just have a CRM; you'll have a fully integrated customer relationship engine that you own, control, and can evolve as your business grows.

## **Before You Begin**

To ensure a smooth process, make sure you have the following:

- **Knowledge**: A solid understanding of `ðŸ§Š Universal Object`, `Data Fields`, and `Workflows`. If you're new to these, review the [Platform Reference](/02-platform/platform-overview) first.
- **Permissions**: You'll need admin or manager privileges to create and configure a new `ðŸ“‹ Function`.
- **Time**: This playbook takes approximately **60-90 minutes** to complete.

## **The 5 Phases of Your CRM Build**

This playbook is broken down into five distinct phases, guiding you from initial strategy to a fully operational system.

    Before you write a single line of code or configure any setting, you must have a plan. In this crucial first step, you will map out your existing sales process, define the key data points you need to track, and set clear goals for what success looks like.

  <Card title="Phase 2: Designing Your Core CRM Objects" icon="cubes" iconType="duotone" href="/build-playbooks/playbooks/build-crm-system/02-design-objects">
    This is where you build the data foundation of your CRM. You will create the three essential `ðŸ§Š Objects` that form the backbone of any sales system: **Contacts**, **Opportunities**, and **Activities**.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Phase 3: Building Your Sales Pipeline with Workflows" icon="arrow-progress" iconType="duotone" href="/build-playbooks/playbooks/build-crm-system/03-setup-workflows">
    Bring your sales process to life. You will configure visual workflows that guide opportunities through each stage of your sales pipeline, ensuring a standardized process for your entire team, from `Prospecting` to `Closed Won`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Phase 4: Automating Lead Capture and Follow-ups" icon="robot" iconType="duotone" href="/build-playbooks/playbooks/build-crm-system/04-create-automation">
    Eliminate manual work and ensure no lead falls through the cracks. You'll learn to build automations that assign new leads, create follow-up tasks, and notify your sales team of critical events in real-time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Phase 5: Creating Sales Analytics and Performance Dashboards" icon="chart-pie" iconType="duotone" href="/build-playbooks/playbooks/build-crm-system/05-build-dashboards">
    What gets measured gets managed. In the final phase, you will build dynamic dashboards to visualize your sales funnel, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and gain actionable insights into your team's performance.
