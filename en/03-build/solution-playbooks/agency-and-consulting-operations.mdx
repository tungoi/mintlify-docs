**A Pattern for Client Services**

<Info>
  This Solution Pattern is designed for businesses that manage multiple clients and projects simultaneously, such as creative agencies, marketing firms, and business consultancies.

  Unlike a construction project which is often linear, agency work involves juggling numerous deliverables, tracking billable time, and managing complex client feedback loops. This pattern provides a robust starting point for building a system to manage that complexity.

    # Tutorial: Building the Agency Operations Hub
    
    ## Section 1: Create the Function & Core Objects
    
    1.  **Create the Function**: Create a new `Function` and name it "Agency Operations Hub".
    2.  **Create the `Client` Object**: Inside the new Function, create an `ðŸ§Š Object` named "Client" with fields for `Client Name`, `Industry`, etc.
    3.  **Create the `Project` Object**: Create an `ðŸ§Š Object` named "Project". Add fields like `Project Type` (use a Select List with "Retainer" and "Fixed-Price" options), `Total Budget`, and `Hourly Rate`.
    4.  **Create the `Deliverable` Object**: Create an `ðŸ§Š Object` named "Deliverable" with `Assigned To` (User) and `Due Date` (Date) fields.
    5.  **Create the `Timesheet Entry` Object**: Create an `ðŸ§Š Object` named "Timesheet Entry" with `Hours` (Number) and `Activity Description` (Text) fields.
    
    ## Section 2: Connecting the Objects
    
    6.  **Link `Project` to `Client`**:
        - Open the `Project` object's configuration.
        - Add an "Object Connection" field named "Client".
        - Configure it to connect to the `Client` object.
    7.  **Link `Deliverable` & `Timesheet` to `Project`**: Repeat the process for the `Deliverable` and `Timesheet Entry` objects, adding an "Object Connection" field in each that links back to the `Project` object.
    
    ## Section 3: Designing the Workflows
    
    8.  **Build the `Project` Workflow**: In the `Project` object's "Workflow" tab, create the statuses: `PITCH`, `PROPOSAL`, `ACTIVE`, `COMPLETED`, `ON HOLD`.
    9.  **Build the `Deliverable` Workflow**: This workflow is key for the creative process. In the `Deliverable` object's "Workflow" tab, create the statuses: `BACKLOG`, `IN PROGRESS`, `INTERNAL REVIEW`, `CLIENT REVIEW`, `APPROVED`.
    
    ## Section 4: Building Key Workviews
    
    10. **Navigate to Workviews**: In the main Function sidebar, click on "Workviews".
    11. **Create the "Deliverable Kanban"**:
        - Click "Add Workview" and select "Kanban".
        - Name it "Deliverable Pipeline".
        - Configure it to use the `Deliverable` object, grouped by the "Status" field. This gives you a view of your entire production floor.

    12. **Create the "Team Workload" View**:
        - Click "Add Workview" and select "List".
        - Name it "Team Workload".
        - Configure it to use the `Deliverable` object.
        - Use the "Group by" option and select the `Assigned To` field. This instantly shows who is working on what.
