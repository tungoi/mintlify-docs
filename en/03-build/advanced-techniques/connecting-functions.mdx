**Breaking Down the Silos**

<Info>
You have learned to build powerful, dedicated `ðŸ“‹ Functions` for different teams. But the true power of Luklak is unlocked when you make those `Functions` talk to each other. The goal is to eliminate the "digital gaps" between your departments.

This guide teaches the two primary methods for connecting `Functions` and creating a single, seamless flow of information across your entire business: **Universal Automation** (for processes) and **Object Connections** (for data).

## **The Core Problem: Functional Silos**

Imagine you have a `Sales & CRM` `ðŸ“‹ Function` and a `Project Delivery` `ðŸ“‹ Function`. They are both perfectly designed for their respective teams, but they don't share information. When a deal is won, a project manager has to manually re-enter all the client data to start the project.

This is a functional silo. Connecting your functions is how you solve it.

## **Method 1: `Universal Automation` for Process Handoffs**

`Universal Automation` is the nervous system of your workspace. You use it to listen for events in one `ðŸ“‹ Function` and trigger actions in another. This is the ideal method for managing **process handoffs**.

    This is the classic handoff we built in the LAIKA case study. When an `ðŸ§Š Opportunity` is marked `WON` in the Sales `Function`, an automation instantly creates a new `ðŸ§Š Project` in the Project Delivery `Function`, copying over all relevant client data.

    When a `ðŸ§Š New Hire` object is moved to the `ONBOARDING` status in an HR `Function`, an automation can create a "New Laptop Setup" `ðŸ§Š Task` in the IT Operations `Function`, automatically assigning it to the IT team.

#### **How it Works**
You build a rule with a trigger (e.g., "Object Transitioned") and an action (e.g., "Create Object"). The key is that when you configure the action, you can choose to create an `ðŸ§Š Object` in **any other `ðŸ“‹ Function` in your workspace**. You then use **Smart Values** (e.g., `{{triggerObject.fieldName}}`) to map data from the source object to the new object.

## **Method 2: `Object Connections` for Data Visibility**

`Object Connections` are used to create a permanent **relationship** between `ðŸ§Š Objects`, even if they live in different `ðŸ“‹ Functions`. This is the ideal method for providing lasting **data visibility** without duplicating information.

  <Card title="Use Case: Central Client Record" icon="address-book" iconType="duotone">
    A `ðŸ§Š Client` object lives in your main CRM `Function`. Multiple `ðŸ§Š Projects` (in Project Delivery), `ðŸ§Š Invoices` (in Finance), and `ðŸ§Š Support Tickets` (in Helpdesk) can all link back to that single client record, providing a true 360-degree view.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Case: Product Catalog" icon="tags" iconType="duotone">
    A `Product Catalog` `Function` can contain all your `ðŸ§Š Product` objects. Your Sales team, working in the CRM `Function`, can then link their `ðŸ§Š Opportunities` to the specific products a client is interested in, pulling in real-time pricing and SKU data.
  </Card>

#### **How it Works**
You add a field of the type "Object Connection" to an `ðŸ§Š Object`. In the field's configuration, you can point it to an `Object` from any other `ðŸ“‹ Function`. Once linked, you can use "Data Table" gadgets on an object's screen to display a live, filterable list of all its connected objects from across the workspace.

## **When to Use Which Method**

- **Use `Universal Automation` when:** You need to react to an **event** and trigger a **process**. It is action-oriented ("When this happens, *do* that.").
- **Use `Object Connections` when:** You need to establish a permanent **relationship** and provide lasting **visibility**. It is data-oriented ("For this object, *show me* all related items.").

**What's Next?**

Now that you understand how to connect your functions into a cohesive system, it's time to think about scale. The next guide covers the best practices for ensuring your solutions remain fast and efficient as your business grows.
