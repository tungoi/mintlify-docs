**Evolving with Confidence**

<Info>
One of Luklak's greatest strengths is its flexibility. Unlike rigid, off-the-shelf software, you can adapt your system as your business processes evolve. But with this power comes the need for a responsible process.

Making changes to a live, mission-critical system can be risky if not handled correctly. This guide provides a safe, structured methodology for managing change, allowing you to innovate with confidence while minimizing disruption to your team.

## **The Core Challenge: Updating a Live System**

Once your team relies on a `üìã Function` for their daily work, any changes can have a significant impact. Modifying a `Workflow`, changing an `Automation`, or removing a `Data Field` could potentially break a process or confuse users.

A structured change management process mitigates these risks.

## **The Recommended Change Management Process**

For anything beyond a minor, cosmetic change, we strongly recommend a "Develop ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Deploy" lifecycle.

    **Never make major changes directly on your live `üìã Function`.** The safest first step is to create a duplicate of your `Function` to use as a "sandbox" environment.

    - **How-to:** Go to your `Function`'s settings, select "Duplicate Function", and give the copy a clear name, such as `[Function Name] - V2 Development`.
    - This creates an identical, isolated copy where you can experiment freely without affecting any real users or data.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Step 2: Develop & Test Your Changes in the Sandbox" icon="user-gear" iconType="duotone">
    With your sandbox copy, you can now safely make all your desired changes. Re-design the `Workflow`, add new `Data Fields`, or build complex new `Automations`.

    - **Critical Sub-step: Testing.** Create a temporary "Test `‚èπÔ∏è Space`" from your sandbox `Function`. Add a small group of power users to this space.
    - Ask them to create sample `üßä Objects` and run through the new process to provide feedback and identify any potential issues before the official rollout.

  <Card title="Step 3: Communicate and Deploy the New Version" icon="rocket-launch" iconType="duotone">
    Once you are confident the new version is working perfectly, it's time to roll it out.

    - **Communication is Key:** Announce the upcoming changes to all users well in advance. Explain **what** is changing, **why** it is changing, and **when** it will happen. Provide a brief training or a link to a user guide.
    - **Deployment Strategy:**
        - **For Minor Changes** (e.g., adding a new, non-critical field): After communicating, you can make these changes directly on the live `Function`, preferably during off-peak hours.
        - **For Major Changes** (e.g., a complete workflow redesign): Use the sandbox method. The deployment involves creating a new, official `‚èπÔ∏è Space` from your perfected V2 `Function`. You then guide users to begin all new work in this new space and implement a plan to archive the old one.
