**The View from the Top**

<Info>
A fully connected and automated system is powerful, but its ultimate value is realized when you can derive clear, real-time insights from it. This is where we deliver the final and most crucial benefit to LAIKA's leadership team.

In this guide, we will solve the last major problem from our business challenge: the lack of unified, real-time reporting. We will build a single executive dashboard that pulls data from both the `Sales & CRM` and `Project Delivery` `ðŸ“‹ Functions`, giving the Board of Directors instant visibility into the health of the entire business.

## **Building the LAIKA Executive Dashboard**

Our goal is to create a single screen that answers the most important questions: How is our sales pipeline performing? What is the status of our active projects? Are we hitting our revenue goals?

# Tutorial: The LAIKA Executive Dashboard

## Section 1: Creating Your Dashboard

1.  **Navigate to Dashboards**: In the main navigation bar of your workspace, find and click on the "Dashboards" item.
2.  **Create a New Dashboard**: Click the "Create Dashboard" button. Let's name it `LAIKA - Executive Overview`.

## Section 2: Adding Sales Performance Gadgets

1.  **Add a Gadget**: On your new blank dashboard, click "Add Gadget".
2.  **Create the Sales Pipeline Chart**:
    - Select the "Chart" gadget.
    - Configure it to use data from the `Sales & CRM` `ðŸ“‹ Function`.
    - Set the `Object Type` to `ðŸ§Š Opportunity`.
    - Choose a "Bar Chart" and set the "Group by" option to the "Status" field.
    - This creates a real-time visualization of your sales funnel.

3.  **Create the Total Won Revenue Counter**:
    - Add another gadget, this time selecting "Statistic".
    - Configure it to show the **SUM** of the `Project Value` field.
    - Add a filter to only include `ðŸ§Š Opportunities` where the `Status` is `WON`.
    - This creates a single, powerful number showing total closed deals.

## Section 3: Adding Project Delivery Gadgets

1.  **Create the Project Status Chart**:
    - Add a "Chart" gadget.
    - Configure it to use data from the `Project Delivery` `ðŸ“‹ Function`.
    - Set the `Object Type` to `ðŸ§Š Project`.
    - Choose a "Pie Chart" and set the "Group by" option to the "Status" field (e.g., `PLANNING`, `DESIGN`, `CONSTRUCTION`).

2.  **Create the Active Projects List**:
    - Add a "Data Table" gadget.
    - Configure it to show a list of `ðŸ§Š Projects` from the `Project Delivery` `ðŸ“‹ Function`.
    - Add a filter so that `Status` **is not** `COMPLETED`.
    - Choose to display key columns like `Project Name`, `Client`, and `End Date`.

## Section 4: Arranging and Sharing

1.  **Arrange Your Dashboard**: Drag and drop the four gadgets you've created into a logical layout.
2.  **Share with Leadership**:
    - Click the "Share" button on your dashboard.
    - Share it with the `Board of Directors` group we created earlier, giving them "View Only" access.
