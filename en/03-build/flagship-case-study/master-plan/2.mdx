**Before You Build, Set the Foundation**

<Info>
You don't build a new office without first deciding who gets keys to which rooms. In Luklak, you don't build `Functions` without first setting up your users and defining their access rights.

This is the crucial "Step 0" of any serious build. Establishing a clear governance structure from the beginning ensures your system is secure, organized, and ready to scale. Getting this right now prevents major headaches later.

## **Step 1: Identify Key Roles at LAIKA**

Based on the end-to-end workflow, we need to account for all the teams and stakeholders who will interact with the system. Each role has different responsibilities and information needs.

- **Board of Directors (BOD):** Needs a real-time, high-level overview of the entire business, from sales pipeline to project profitability.
- **Marketing Team:** Responsible for running campaigns and capturing new leads.
- **Sales Team:** Responsible for consulting with leads, developing opportunities, and closing deals.
- **Design Team:** Responsible for creative work, submitting designs for approval, and collaborating on revisions.
- **Site Team:** Responsible for managing on-site construction and filing progress reports.
- **Accounting Team:** Responsible for creating contracts, managing invoices, and tracking payments.
- **The Client:** An external stakeholder who needs to review and approve key deliverables, like design concepts.

## **Step 2: Create Groups for Team-Based Access**

Instead of assigning permissions to individuals, the best practice is to create `Groups`. This allows you to manage access rights at the team level, which is far more efficient and scalable.

For LAIKA, we will create the following core groups:

    For the CEO and leadership who require high-level administrative and viewing privileges across all functions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Marketing Team" icon="bullhorn" iconType="duotone">
    This group will have primary access to the lead capture data and marketing campaign performance.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sales Team" icon="handshake" iconType="duotone">
    This group will be given access to the CRM `Function` to manage leads and opportunities.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Design Team" icon="palette" iconType="duotone">
    For all designers. This group will primarily work within the Project Delivery `Function` on creative tasks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Site Team" icon="person-digging" iconType="duotone">
    For managers and staff who work on the construction site and need to file reports from the field.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Finance Team" icon="calculator" iconType="duotone">
    For accountants who will manage contracts, invoices, and payments, requiring specific access to financial data.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## **Step 3: Setting Up Your First Group**

The process is the same for all groups. Let's start where the entire LAIKA workflow begins: with the `Marketing Team`.

* Tip: Now, any permissions you grant to the "Marketing Team" group will automatically apply to all its members.

**What's Next?**

The foundation is poured and the teams are organized. We are now ready to build the first specialized tool for our `Sales Team`: the CRM `Function`, which receives the leads captured by Marketing.
