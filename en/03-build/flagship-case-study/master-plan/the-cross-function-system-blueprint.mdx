**The Architect's Approach**

<Info>
The solution to the chaos described in the previous article is not simply a "better app"â€”it's a better **system**. Instead of treating each department as a separate island, we will design the flow of information across the entire company intentionally.

This blueprint represents the "single source of truth" for LAIKA's entire operation. It's the master plan we will build throughout this case study, designed to eliminate data silos, automate manual work, and give every team the context they need to succeed.

## **The LAIKA Cross-Function Blueprint**

At the heart of the solution is a system of interconnected `Functions`, with a central `Project` acting as the hub that ties everything together. Every piece of information, from the first sales call to the final invoice, is linked to a single, unified project record.

This architecture is built on three core principles:

  <Card title="1. A Central Project Hub" icon="sitemap" iconType="duotone">
    The `Project` ðŸ§Š Object is the gravitational center of the entire system. The sales `Opportunity`, client `Contacts`, `Design Concepts`, `Site Reports`, and `Invoices` are all connected to this central hub, providing a true 360-degree view of any client engagement.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Dedicated Functions for Each Team" icon="users-gear" iconType="duotone">
    Each department gets a dedicated `ðŸ“‹ Function` tailored to their specific needs. The Sales team gets a CRM `Function` with a sales pipeline, while the Design team gets a `Function` with workflows for creative approvals, ensuring every team works in a way that makes sense for them.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Seamless Automated Handoffs" icon="arrows-spin" iconType="duotone">
    This is where the magic happens. When a key stage is completed in one `Function` (like a deal being marked `WON` in the CRM), `Universal Automation` instantly triggers the next stage in another `Function` (like creating the `Project` for the delivery team). This eliminates manual handoffs and "dead time" between departments.

**What's Next?**

With the high-level blueprint understood, the first step in any real build is to set up the foundational rules and user structures. Before we build any `Functions`, we must first configure the system's governance layer.
