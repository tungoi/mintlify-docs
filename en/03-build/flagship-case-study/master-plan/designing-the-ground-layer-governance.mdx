**Before You Build, Set the Foundation**

<Info>
You don't build a new office without first deciding who gets keys to which rooms. In Luklak, you don't build `Functions` without first setting up your users and defining their access rights.

This is the crucial "Step 0" of any serious build. Establishing a clear governance structure from the beginning ensures your system is secure, organized, and ready to scale. Getting this right now prevents major headaches later.

## **Step 1: Identify Key Roles at LAIKA**

Before creating any groups or permissions, we first need to identify the distinct roles within the LAIKA organization. Each role has different responsibilities and different information needs.

- **Management (CEO, Dept. Heads):** Need a high-level overview of the entire business, from sales pipeline to project profitability.
- **Salesperson:** Needs to manage leads, opportunities, and client communication.
- **Project Manager:** Needs to oversee a project's entire lifecycle, including budget, timeline, and tasks.
- **Designer:** Needs to work on creative tasks, submit designs for approval, and collaborate on revisions.
- **Site Manager:** Needs to report on-site progress and issues from the field.
- **Accountant:** Needs to create contracts, manage invoices, and track payments.

## **Step 2: Create Groups for Team-Based Access**

Instead of assigning permissions to individuals one by one, the best practice is to create `Groups`. This way, when a new employee joins, you can simply add them to the correct group to grant them all the necessary access instantly.

For LAIKA, we will create the following core groups:

  <Card title="Management" icon="crown" iconType="duotone">
    For the CEO and department heads who require high-level administrative and viewing privileges across all functions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sales Team" icon="handshake" iconType="duotone">
    For all salespeople. This group will be given access to the CRM `Function` to manage leads and opportunities.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Project Managers" icon="user-helmet-safety" iconType="duotone">
    A group for the PMs who orchestrate project delivery from start to finish.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Design Team" icon="palette" iconType="duotone">
    For all designers. This group will primarily work within the Project Delivery `Function` on creative tasks.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Site Team" icon="person-digging" iconType="duotone">
    For managers and staff who work on the construction site and need to file reports from the field.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Finance Team" icon="calculator" iconType="duotone">
    For accountants who will manage contracts, invoices, and payments. They will need specific access to financial data.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## **Step 3: Setting Up Your First Group**

Let's walk through creating the `Sales Team` group. The process is the same for all other groups.

* Tip: Now, instead of managing permissions for 5 individual salespeople, you only need to manage permissions for this one group.

**What's Next?**

The foundation is poured and the teams are organized. We are now ready to build the first specialized tool for our `Sales Team`: the CRM `Function`.
