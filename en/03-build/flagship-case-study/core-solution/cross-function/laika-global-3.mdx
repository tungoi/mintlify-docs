  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Layer 2: Item Access">
    <Info>
      These principles act as a guide for Administrators when assigning access to the "containers" of work and shared assets.

  <Tab title="Layer 3: Permission & Notification Schemes">
    <Info>
      This is the most granular layer of control, defining "who can do what" and "who gets notified about what" for Objects within a Space.
    </Info>
    | Scheme Type             | Selected Scheme for LAIKA                    | Description & Rationale                                                                                                                                                                      |
    | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Permission Scheme**   | **"Moderate restriction"**                   | **Balances security and collaboration:** Everyone in a Space can see that work exists, but only directly assigned users can view details and make updates, protecting sensitive information. |
    | **Notification Scheme** | **"Notify key actions to direct assignees"** | **Reduces notification noise:** Only important events (status changes, @mentions) trigger alerts for directly involved users, helping the team focus on actionable updates.                  |
