  <Tab title="Layer 3: Permission & Notification Schemes">
    <Info>

    | **Permission Scheme**   | **"Moderate restriction"**                   | **Balances security and collaboration:** Everyone in a Space can see that work exists, but only directly assigned users can view details and make updates, protecting sensitive information. |
    | **Notification Scheme** | **"Notify key actions to direct assignees"** | **Reduces notification noise:** Only important events (status changes, @mentions) trigger alerts for directly involved users, helping the team focus on actionable updates.                  |
