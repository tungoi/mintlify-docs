    | **Member**      | All remaining employees                                 | The standard privilege for most users, allowing them to work within the Spaces ⏹️ they are given access to. |
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Layer 2: Item Access">
    <Info>
      These principles act as a guide for Administrators when assigning access to the "containers" of work and shared assets.
    </Info>
    | Item Type                  | Permission Principle                                                                                                                 | Rationale & Benefit                                                                                                                              |

    | **📂 Areas**               | - **Admin:** CEO, COO<br />- **Manager:** Head of the respective Area<br />- **Member:** The respective department's Group           | Creates a focused work environment for each department, reducing clutter and improving navigation efficiency.                                    |
    | **👥 Groups**              | - **Manager:** Head of the respective department<br />- **Member:** All members of the Group                                         | Empowers department heads to manage their own team membership, increasing agility and reducing the load on System Admins.                        |
    | **📊Dashboards & Filters** | - **Admin:** The creator, CEO, COO<br />- **Manager:** Relevant Heads of Areas<br />- **Member:** Shared-with Groups or individuals  | Ensures that aggregated data and sensitive business metrics are shared only with the intended audience.                                          |
    | **📋 Functions**           | - **Admin:** System Administrator, CEO, COO<br />- **Manager:** Users with `App Manager` privilege<br />- **Member:** Most employees | Tightly governs core business processes while allowing department heads the flexibility to refine them and enabling all employees to apply them. |

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Layer 3: Permission & Notification Schemes">
    <Info>
      This is the most granular layer of control, defining "who can do what" and "who gets notified about what" for Objects within a Space.
    </Info>
    | Scheme Type             | Selected Scheme for LAIKA                    | Description & Rationale                                                                                                                                                                      |
    | :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **Permission Scheme**   | **"Moderate restriction"**                   | **Balances security and collaboration:** Everyone in a Space can see that work exists, but only directly assigned users can view details and make updates, protecting sensitive information. |
    | **Notification Scheme** | **"Notify key actions to direct assignees"** | **Reduces notification noise:** Only important events (status changes, @mentions) trigger alerts for directly involved users, helping the team focus on actionable updates.                  |
