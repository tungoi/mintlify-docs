<Info>
  **Purpose:** This document defines the **internal** operational logic of the Construction Management `ðŸ“‹ Function`. It governs the on-site execution of project work, from planning and resource allocation to daily progress tracking and formal acceptance of completed work.
</Info>

## Why This Matters 

<Info>
  This `ðŸ“‹ Function` brings structure and real-time visibility to the complexities of on-site construction. It focuses on operational excellence by tracking daily progress, managing resource allocation, and ensuring quality control through a formal acceptance process. Strategically, this provides managers with a clear view of on-the-ground progress against the master plan, enabling proactive issue resolution and ensuring adherence to budget and quality standards. For site supervisors and construction teams, it digitizes daily reporting, clarifies task ownership, and streamlines the processes for material requests and work acceptance.
</Info>

## The Big Picture

<Info>
  Architecturally, this `ðŸ“‹ Function` is the execution engine of the project lifecycle, taking inputs from the high-level `ðŸ§Š Project` and `ðŸ§Š Design Drawing`. It is centered around the `ðŸ§Š Construction Category` object, which represents a major phase of work (e.g., Electrical, Plumbing). This central object is supported by a `ðŸ§Šï¸Ž Construction Task` sub-object for granular work management. All other key processes, including `ðŸ§Š Construction Logs`, `ðŸ§Š Material Requests`, and `ðŸ§Š Acceptance Records`, are linked directly to a `ðŸ§Š Construction Category`, making it the operational hub for all on-site activities.
