**From Plan to Production**

<Info>
  With our governance layer in place, it's time to build the first specialized tool for the LAIKA `Sales Team`: their Customer Relationship Management (CRM) `Function`. This is where we apply the **8-Step Design Methodology** to create the system that will manage the entire sales process, from new lead to closed deal.

  In this guide, you can switch between the **Blueprint** tab to see the design specifications, and the **Build Tutorial** tab for the hands-on, step-by-step instructions.

    ### **1. Analysis & Scope**

    The CRM must capture new leads, allow salespeople to manage opportunities through a pipeline, and provide visibility for management. It will serve as the single source of truth for all client and deal-related information prior to project handoff.

    ### **``2. Universal Objects & Data Fields``**

    The CRM is built around three core `ðŸ§Š Objects`:

    - **`Lead`**: Represents a new, unqualified inquiry.
      - _Key Fields_: `Full Name`, `Email`, `Phone`, `Lead Source`.
    - **`Opportunity`**: A qualified lead that has entered the sales pipeline. This is the central object for tracking deals.
      - _Key Fields_: `Opportunity Name`, `Project Value` (Currency), `Estimated Close Date` (Date), `Assigned To` (User).
    - **`Contact`**: A person associated with a `Lead` or `Opportunity`.

    ### **`3. Workflow & Statuses`**

    The `Opportunity` object will have a defined sales pipeline to track its lifecycle:

    - `NEW LEAD`
    - `CONSULTING`
    - `PROPOSAL`
    - `NEGOTIATION`
    - `WON`
    - `LOST`

    ### **`4. Workviews & Dashboards`**

    The `Sales Team` requires one primary `Workview` to manage their daily work:

    - **"Sales Pipeline Kanban"**: A Kanban board organized by the `Opportunity` status, providing a clear visual of the entire pipeline.

    # Tutorial: Building the CRM Function
    
    ## Section 1: Create the Core Objects
    
    1.  **Navigate to Function Designer**: Open your LAIKA `Function` and go to "Object Types".
    2.  **Create the `Opportunity` Object**: Click "Add Object Type" and name it "Opportunity".
    3.  **Create the `Lead` Object**: Repeat the process to create another Object Type named "Lead".
    
    ## Section 2: Configure Key Data Fields
    
    1.  **Open the `Opportunity` Object**: In the Object Types list, click on "Opportunity".
    2.  **Add `Project Value` Field**: Click "Add Field", select the "Currency" field type, and name it "Project Value".
    3.  **Add `Estimated Close Date` Field**: Click "Add Field" again, select the "Date" field type, and name it "Estimated Close Date".

    ## Section 3: Design the Sales Pipeline Workflow
    
    1.  **Open Workflow Editor**: In the `Opportunity` Object settings, click on "Workflow".
    2.  **Create Statuses**: Click "Add Status" and create each status from the blueprint: `NEW LEAD`, `CONSULTING`, `PROPOSAL`, `NEGOTIATION`, `WON`, and `LOST`.
    3.  **Set Status Categories**: For `WON`, set the category to "SUCCESS". For `LOST`, set it to "FAILURE". This helps with reporting.

    2.  **Create New Workview**: Click "Add Workview" and select "Kanban".
    3.  **Configure the Kanban**:
        - Set the `Object Type` to "Opportunity".

        - Name the view "Sales Pipeline Kanban" and save it.

**What's Next?**

Now that the CRM `Function` is built to manage the sales process, the next step is to build the `Function` that will handle the work _after_ a deal is won: the Project Delivery system.
