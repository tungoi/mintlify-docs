<Info>
  **Purpose:** This document defines the **internal** operational logic of the Interior Design `üìã Function`. It governs the creation, review, and approval of all client-facing design deliverables.
</Info>

## Why This Matters

This `üìã Function` streamlines the creative process by organizing all design deliverables under a single package, ensuring a consistent and clear approval workflow for each asset type. It provides a centralized hub for all design communication and files, reducing the risk of errors from using outdated versions. Strategically, this creates an auditable record of client feedback and approvals, accelerates the design phase, and ensures a smooth handover of finalized assets to the project execution teams.

## The Big Picture

Architecturally, this `üìã Function` is initiated in parallel with a `üßä Project`. The central object is the `üßä Design`, which acts as the main container for the entire design scope. This package holds four distinct types of sub-objects: `üßäÔ∏é Floor Plan`, `üßäÔ∏é Concept`, `üßäÔ∏é 3D`, and `üßäÔ∏é 2D`, each representing a key deliverable. Each of these sub-objects follows its own lifecycle of creation, feedback, and approval, allowing for granular tracking of the entire design effort.

## OBJECT TYPES & WORKFLOWS

### 1. üßä Design (Standard Object)

- **Process Description**: The top-level container for a complete design package for a client project. It groups all related deliverables like floor plans, concepts, and 3D/2D drawings.
- **Example**: "Design - Sarah & Michael Westbrook".

    | **1. NEW**              | The `Design` Object has been created and is in the initial briefing phase where requirements are gathered.            | **Automation**: A set of standard child `üßäÔ∏é Deliverable` Objects (e.g., Floor Plan, Concept, 3D Render) can be created from a template. |
    | **2. IN PROGRESS**      | The design team is actively working on the various deliverables within the design package.                            | **Transition Permissions**: Lead Designer.                                                                                               |

    | **4. REVISION**         | The client has requested changes, sending the design package back to the `IN PROGRESS` status for the team to action. | **Data Input**: A required field for "Revision Notes" should capture the client's feedback.                                              |
    | **5. APPROVED**         | The client has formally approved the entire design package.                                                           | **Condition**: All child `üßäÔ∏é Deliverable` Objects must be in `APPROVED` status before the parent package can be moved to `APPROVED`.    |
    | **6. HANDED OVER**      | The finalized and approved design assets have been delivered to the Project Management and Construction teams.        | **This is the terminal status for the Design function's workflow.** It can trigger a status change on the parent `üßä Project`.           |
