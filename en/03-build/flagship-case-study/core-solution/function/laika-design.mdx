title: "Interior Design Function"
---

<Info>
  **Purpose:** This document defines the **internal** operational logic of the Interior Design `üìã Function`. It governs the creation, review, and approval of all client-facing design deliverables.
</Info>

## Why This Matters

This `üìã Function` streamlines the creative process by organizing all design deliverables under a single package, ensuring a consistent and clear approval workflow for each asset type. It provides a centralized hub for all design communication and files, reducing the risk of errors from using outdated versions. Strategically, this creates an auditable record of client feedback and approvals, accelerates the design phase, and ensures a smooth handover of finalized assets to the project execution teams.

## The Big Picture

Architecturally, this `üìã Function` is initiated in parallel with a `üßä Project`. The central object is the `üßä Design Package`, which acts as the main container for the entire design scope. This package holds four distinct types of sub-objects: `üßäÔ∏é Floor Plan`, `üßäÔ∏é Concept`, `üßäÔ∏é 3D`, and `üßäÔ∏é 2D`, each representing a key deliverable. Each of these sub-objects follows its own lifecycle of creation, feedback, and approval, allowing for granular tracking of the entire design effort.

### 2. Design Deliverables (Sub-Objects)

The following four objects (`üßäÔ∏é Floor Plan`, `üßäÔ∏é Concept`, `üßäÔ∏é 3D`, `üßäÔ∏é 2D`) represent the core deliverables of the design process. They all share a common workflow for creation, feedback, and approval.
