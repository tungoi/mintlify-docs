<Info>
  **Purpose:** This document defines the **internal** operational logic of the Design Management `📋 Function`. It manages the entire creative process, from initial concept development to final client approval and the handover of technical drawings to the project management team.
</Info>

## Why This Matters

This `📋 Function` provides a structured and collaborative platform for the entire design lifecycle, ensuring that client feedback is systematically captured and design versions are meticulously tracked. It centralizes all design files, feedback, and approvals, preventing miscommunication and the use of outdated files. Strategically, this accelerates the approval process, creates a clear audit trail of design decisions, and ensures the final, approved designs are seamlessly integrated into the project execution plan. 

## The Big Picture

Architecturally, this `📋 Function` operates in parallel with the early stages of the Project Management `📋 Function`. It is built upon an extensive hierarchical data model, starting with the `🧊 Design Drawing` as the main container, which links to a parent `🧊 Project`. This container is broken down through four levels of sub-objects: `🧊︎ Design Category`, `🧊︎ Design Space`, `🧊︎ Item in Space`, and finally, `🧊︎ File Version`. This deep structure allows for granular control and tracking of every single design element, from a high-level 3D render down to a specific version of a cabinet drawing.

    | 2. DESIGNING         | The design team is actively working on creating the concepts and drawings.                               | **Input Screen**: Designers upload `File Version` sub-objects.                                       |
    | 3. AWAITING FEEDBACK | A version has been sent to the client and the team is waiting for review and comments.                   | **Automation**: Sends a notification to the Client that a new version is available for review.       |
    | 4. FINALIZED         | The client has approved the overall design plan. No more creative changes are expected.                  | **Condition**: All child `Design Category` objects must be in a "Completed" status.                  |
    | 5. HANDED OVER       | The finalized set of technical drawings has been delivered to the Project Management team for execution. | **Automation**: Copies the approved files to the related `Project`'s "Construction Drawings" folder. |

## AUTOMATIONS

| Rule                                | Trigger                                                    | Action                                                                                                                                   |
| :---------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. **Create Default Structure**     | A `🧊 Design Drawing` is created.                          | Automatically creates a standard set of sub-objects: `🧊︎ Design Category` (3D, 2D) and `🧊︎ Design Space` (Living Room, Bedroom, etc.). |
| 2. **Notify Client of New Version** | A `🧊︎ File Version` is moved to `PENDING REVIEW`.         | Sends an automated email or portal notification to the client with a link to view the file and provide feedback.                         |
| 3. **Update Parent Status**         | All `🧊︎ File Version` objects for an item are `APPROVED`. | Automatically changes the status of the parent `🧊︎ Item in Space` to `COMPLETED`. This rolls up the hierarchy.                          |
