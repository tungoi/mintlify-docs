<Info>
  **Purpose:** This document defines the **internal** operational logic of the Marketing Campaigns `ðŸ“‹ Function`. It covers the management of campaigns and ads to generate and qualify leads before handing them over to the Sales `ðŸ“‹ Function`.
</Info>

## Why This Matters

<Info>
  This `ðŸ“‹ Function` establishes a standardized and measurable process for managing all advertising activities. It ensures every ad is tracked consistently with automated UTM generation, providing clear data on campaign performance. Strategically, this allows for the precise calculation of lead costs and the overall return on investment for marketing spend. For the marketing team, it streamlines the ad creation and approval process, reducing manual work and enabling a focus on campaign effectiveness.
</Info>


## The Big Picture

<Info>
  Architecturally, this `ðŸ“‹ Function` serves as the starting point of the customer journey. It is built around two core `ðŸ§Š Objects`: the `ðŸ§Š Marketing Campaign` and its child, the `ðŸ§Šï¸Ž Ad`. Its primary output is a qualified lead, which triggers the creation of a `ðŸ§Š Customer` in the downstream CRM `ðŸ“‹ Function` via an automated rule. This creates a seamless data flow from the first ad impression to the final sale.
