<Info>
  **Purpose:** This document defines the **internal** operational logic of the Customer Success `ðŸ“‹ Function`. It governs the process of receiving and resolving client feedback and issues during the post-handover and warranty period.
</Info>

## Why This Matters

This `ðŸ“‹ Function` is dedicated to managing the client experience after project completion, ensuring a systematic and professional approach to all post-handover support. It provides a centralized system for tracking client issues from reception to resolution, which is critical for maintaining high client satisfaction and fostering long-term loyalty. Strategically, it transforms client feedback into a valuable data asset for improving service quality and identifying common product or service issues. For the support team, it ensures no request is lost and provides clear data on team performance and resolution times.

## The Big Picture

Architecturally, this `ðŸ“‹ Function` is activated during the warranty phase of a `ðŸ§Š Project`. It is built around the `ðŸ§Š Customer Success Ticket` as the standard object, which can be created automatically from external channels like a Zalo support account. Each ticket serves as a case file for a client's request. To manage the internal work required for a resolution, `ðŸ§Šï¸Ž Resolution Task` sub-objects are created and assigned to technical staff. This structure separates client communication (managed in the ticket) from the internal work needed to solve the issue (managed in the tasks).

    | 1. NEW               | A new ticket is received from a client via Zalo or email and awaits assignment.                              | **Automation**: Assigns the ticket to a CS Staff member based on a round-robin system.                                      |
    | 2. IN PROGRESS       | The ticket has been assigned and is being actively worked on. The team creates `Resolution Tasks` as needed. | **Permissions**: Assigned CS Staff.                                                                                         |

    | 5. CLOSED            | The ticket is complete and archived.                                                                         | **Permissions**: Read-only.                                                                                                 |

## What's Next?

- [**Project Management Function**](https://claude.ai/chat/path/to/project-function): Review the function that manages the project during the construction and handover phases, which precedes the warranty period managed here.
