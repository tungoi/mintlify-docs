<Info>
  **Purpose:** This document defines the **internal** operational logic of the Customer Success `üìã Function`. It governs the process of receiving and resolving client feedback and issues during the post-handover and warranty period.
</Info>

## Why This Matters

This `üìã Function` is dedicated to managing the client experience after project completion, ensuring a systematic and professional approach to all post-handover support. It provides a centralized system for tracking client issues from reception to resolution, which is critical for maintaining high client satisfaction and fostering long-term loyalty. Strategically, it transforms client feedback into a valuable data asset for improving service quality and identifying common product or service issues. For the support team, it ensures no request is lost and provides clear data on team performance and resolution times.

## The Big Picture

Architecturally, this `üìã Function` is activated during the warranty phase of a `üßä Project`. It is built around the `üßä Customer Success Ticket` as the standard object, which can be created automatically from external channels like a Zalo support account. Each ticket serves as a case file for a client's request. To manage the internal work required for a resolution, `üßäÔ∏é Resolution Task` sub-objects are created and assigned to technical staff. This structure separates client communication (managed in the ticket) from the internal work needed to solve the issue (managed in the tasks).

    | :------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | **1. ACTIVE**             | The client is under warranty or in a period of active monitoring. Regular check-ins are scheduled and performed. This is the default state. | **Automation**: The `Schedule & Trigger Recurring Check-ins` rule is active.                                     |
    | **2. SUPPORT**            | The client has an active support request or issue that needs resolution.                                                                    | **Transition Permissions**: CS Agent. <br /> **Condition**: A `üßäÔ∏é Support Ticket` sub-object should be open.    |

    | **4. DORMANT**            | The active warranty and check-in period has ended. The client is now in a long-term, low-touch monitoring phase.                            | **Transition Permissions**: CS Agent, CS Manager.                                                                |
