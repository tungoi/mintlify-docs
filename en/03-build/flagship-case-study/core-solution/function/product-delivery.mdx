**The Core Operational Engine**

<Info>
  After a deal is won in the CRM, the real work begins. This guide shows how to build the **Project Delivery** `Function`, the most critical part of LAIKA's operating system. This single `Function` will manage a project's entire lifecycle, from the initial planning phase through design, construction, and final invoicing, creating a single source of truth for the entire delivery team.

  As before, you can switch between the **Blueprint** tab for design specs and the **Build Tutorial** tab for hands-on instructions.

    ### **1. Function & Scope**

    - **Function Name**: `Project Delivery`
    - **Scope**: To manage all post-sale activities for a client project, unifying the Design, Site, and Finance teams into a single, cohesive workflow.

    ### **``2. Universal Objects & Data Fields``**

    This function uses a central "hub" `Object` with several supporting "spoke" `Objects`.

    - **`Project (The Hub)`**: The central record for a client engagement.
      - _Fields_: `Project Name` (Text), `Client` (Object Connection to Contact), `Total Budget` (Currency), `Start Date` (Date), `End Date` (Date).
    - **`Design Concept`**: Tracks a specific creative design and its approval cycle.
      - _Fields_: `Version` (Text), `Status` (Workflow), `Design File` (Attachment).
    - **`Site Report`**: A report filed from the construction site.
      - _Fields_: `Report Date` (Date), `Progress Photos` (Attachment), `Notes` (Text).
    - **`Invoice`**: A financial record for a specific payment milestone.
      - _Fields_: `Invoice Amount` (Currency), `Due Date` (Date), `Status` (Workflow).

    ### **`3. Object Connections`**

    - The `Project` object is the "parent."
    - `Design Concept`, `Site Report`, and `Invoice` are "children" that are always linked to a specific parent `Project`.

    ### **`4. Workflows & Statuses`**

    - **`Project Workflow:`**
      - `PLANNING` → `DESIGN` → `CONSTRUCTION` → `WARRANTY` → `COMPLETED`
    - **`Design Concept Workflow:`**
      - `PENDING` → `IN PROGRESS` → `IN REVIEW` → `APPROVED` → `REJECTED`
    - **`Invoice Workflow:`**
      - `DRAFT` → `SENT` → `PAID` → `OVERDUE`

    ### **`5. Workviews & Dashboards`**

    - **"All Active Projects (List)"**: A master list of all ongoing projects.
    - **"Project Delivery Timeline"**: A timeline/Gantt view of all projects, using their Start and End Dates.
    - **"Design Approval Kanban"**: A Kanban board for the `Design Concept` object, grouped by its status.

    # Tutorial: Building the Project Delivery Function (Full Detail)
    
    ## Section 1: Initial Setup
    
    1.  **Create the Function**: Create a new `Function`, name it "Project Delivery", and choose an icon.
    2.  **Navigate to Object Types**: Inside the new Function, go to "Object Types" in the sidebar.
    
    ## Section 2: Building the Core `Project` Object
    
    3.  **Create the `Project` Object**: Click "Add Object Type" and name it "Project".
    4.  **Add `Project` Fields**:
        - Click on the "Project" object to configure it.
        - Go to the "Fields" tab and add: `Project Name` (Text), `Total Budget` (Currency), `Start Date` (Date), and `End Date` (Date).
        - Add an **Object Connection** field named "Client" and configure it to connect to the `Contact` object from your "Sales & CRM" Function.
    5.  **Design the `Project` Workflow**:
        - Go to the "Workflow" tab for the `Project` object.
        - Create the statuses: `PLANNING`, `DESIGN`, `CONSTRUCTION`, `WARRANTY`, and `COMPLETED`. Set the category for `COMPLETED` to "Success".
    
    ## Section 3: Building the Sub-Process Objects
    
    6.  **Create the `Design Concept` Object**:
        - Go back to "Object Types" and create a new object named "Design Concept".
        - Add a "Design File" (Attachment) field.
        - Go to its "Workflow" tab and create the statuses: `PENDING`, `IN PROGRESS`, `IN REVIEW`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`.
    
    7.  **Create the `Site Report` Object**:
        - Create a new object named "Site Report".
        - Add a "Progress Photos" (Attachment) field and a "Notes" (Text) field.
    
    8.  **Create the `Invoice` Object**:
        - Create a new object named "Invoice".
        - Add an "Invoice Amount" (Currency) field and a "Due Date" (Date) field.
        - Go to its "Workflow" tab and create the statuses: `DRAFT`, `SENT`, `PAID`, `OVERDUE`.
    
    ## Section 4: Linking Sub-Objects to the Main Project
    
    9.  **Navigate back to the `Project` Object**: From the "Object Types" list, click on "Project".
    10. **Add a `Design Concepts` Table**:
        - Go to the "Data Screens" tab. This lets you customize the layout of the `Project` object's screen.
        - Click "Add Gadget" and select the **"Data Table"** gadget.
        - Configure the gadget to show all `Design Concept` objects that are linked to the current `Project`.
        ![Adding a Data Table gadget to the Project screen](https://path/to/data-table-setup.png)
    11. **Repeat for `Site Reports` and `Invoices`**: Add two more "Data Table" gadgets to the screen to show lists of all related `Site Reports` and `Invoices`. This creates the unified 360-degree view.
    
    ## Section 5: Building Key Workviews
    
    12. **Create the "Project Delivery Timeline"**:
        - In the main Function sidebar, click on "Workviews".
        - Click "Add Workview" and select the "Timeline" type.
        - Configure the view to use the `Project` object, with the `Start Date` and `End Date` fields driving the timeline bars.
    13. **Create the "Design Approval Kanban"**:
        - Add another `Workview`, this time selecting "Kanban".
        - Configure it to use the `Design Concept` object, and set the "Group by" option to its "Status" field.

**What's Next?**

We have now built the two core `Functions` for LAIKA's operation. The next critical step is to connect them. We will use `Universal Automation` to make the handoff from the Sales team to the Project Delivery team seamless and instant.
