<Info>
This document is the complete technical blueprint for the **LAIKA Marketing `ðŸ“‹ Function`**. It contains the unabridged design specifications, intended for Solution Architects (P2) and System Builders (P3) who need a deep understanding of the function's architecture.
</Info>

## **1. Objective (Má»¥c tiÃªu)**

To manage and measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, from ad creation to lead capture and source analysis, with a specific focus on the interior design & construction industry.

---

## **2. Entities & Relationships (Thá»±c thá»ƒ & Quan há»‡)**

The data model is designed as a three-level hierarchy to accurately represent the structure of modern marketing campaigns.

| Entity | Analogy (We Mean...) | Role in the System | Key Connections |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`ðŸ§Š Campaign`** | The **Strategy** | The top-level `Standard Object` for a major marketing initiative (e.g., "Summer 2025 Launch"). | Contains multiple `Ad Sets`. |
| **`ðŸ§Š Ad Set`** | The **Targeting** | A `Sub-Object` used to group ads by a common theme or audience (e.g., "Facebook Ads - Age 25-35"). | Belongs to one `Campaign`; contains multiple `Ads`. |
| **`ðŸ§Š Ad`** | The **Creative** | The most granular `Sub-Object`; the specific ad creative that a potential customer interacts with. | Belongs to one `Ad Set`; connects to a `Customer` in the CRM `Function`. |

**Cross-Function Connection:** An `Ad` `Object` is linked to the `Customer` `Object` it generates in the **Sales CRM Function**, providing a direct, measurable line from marketing spend to the sales pipeline.

## **3. Main Operational Flow (Luá»“ng váº­n hÃ nh chÃ­nh)**

This is the standard, end-to-end process for using the Marketing Function from campaign creation to analysis.

## **5. Key Automations (Tá»± Ä‘á»™ng hÃ³a chÃ­nh)**

These automations are the core of the function, designed to eliminate manual tasks and ensure perfect data integrity.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
    <Card title="Automation 1: Automatic UTM Generation" icon="link" iconType="duotone">
        **Trigger:** When a new `Ad` `Object` is created.
        <br/>
        **Action:** The system automatically generates a unique tracking URL (UTM link) and populates it into the "UTM Tracking Link" `Data Field` on the `Ad` `Object`.
        <br/>
        **Purpose:** Ensures all traffic from every ad is properly attributed without manual link creation.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Automation 2: Automatic Lead Creation & Connection" icon="user-plus" iconType="duotone">
        **Trigger:** When an **Incoming Webhook** is received from an external lead capture form.
        <br/>
        **Actions:** 
        <ol>
            <li>**Create Object:** A new `Customer` `Object` is created in the `Sales CRM` `Function`, mapping form data (name, email, etc.) to the `Customer`'s fields.</li>
            <li>**Connect Objects:** The system establishes a connection between the newly created `Customer` and the source `Ad` `Object` (identified via the UTM in the webhook payload).</li>
        </ol>
        **Purpose:** Creates a seamless, real-time link between a marketing action and a sales-ready lead, providing a true end-to-end view of the funnel.
