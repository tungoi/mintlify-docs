<Info>
  **Purpose:** This document defines the **internal** operational logic of the Project Management `ðŸ“‹ Function`. It governs the entire project execution process, from initial setup after a contract is signed to final handover and warranty.
</Info>

## Why This Matters

This `ðŸ“‹ Function` provides a unified, transparent, and structured environment for managing complex interior design and construction projects. It replaces scattered information across different tools with a single source of truth for project timelines, budgets, tasks, and communications. Strategically, this enables real-time project health monitoring, precise budget control, and improved client satisfaction through predictable delivery. For project managers and teams, it clarifies responsibilities, automates progress tracking, and ensures a consistent workflow for every project.

## The Big Picture

Architecturally, this `ðŸ“‹ Function` is the operational core of the business, activated once a deal is closed in the CRM `ðŸ“‹ Function`. It is built on a sophisticated data model involving five interconnected `ðŸ§Š Objects`. The structure is hierarchical, with the `ðŸ§Š Project` as the central container. `ðŸ§Š Construction Categories` and `ðŸ§Šï¸Žï¸Ž Tasks` form a work breakdown structure, while `ðŸ§Š Materials` and `ðŸ§Š Construction Logs` are linked in to manage procurement and daily progress respectively. This interconnected system provides a comprehensive, 360-degree view of all project activities.
