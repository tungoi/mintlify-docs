<Info>
  **Purpose:** This document defines the **internal** operational logic of the Project Management `📋 Function`. It governs the entire project execution process, from initial setup after a contract is signed to final handover and warranty.
</Info>

## Why This Matters

This `📋 Function` provides a unified, transparent, and structured environment for managing complex interior design and construction projects. It replaces scattered information across different tools with a single source of truth for project timelines, budgets, tasks, and communications. Strategically, this enables real-time project health monitoring, precise budget control, and improved client satisfaction through predictable delivery. For project managers and teams, it clarifies responsibilities, automates progress tracking, and ensures a consistent workflow for every project.

## The Big Picture

Architecturally, this `📋 Function` is the operational core of the business, activated once a deal is closed in the CRM `📋 Function`. It is built on a sophisticated data model involving five interconnected `🧊 Objects`. The structure is hierarchical, with the `🧊 Project` as the central container. `🧊 Construction Categories` and `🧊︎︎ Tasks` form a work breakdown structure, while `🧊 Materials` and `🧊 Construction Logs` are linked in to manage procurement and daily progress respectively. This interconnected system provides a comprehensive, 360-degree view of all project activities.

## OBJECT TYPES & WORKFLOWS

### 1. 🧊 Project (Standard Object)

- **Process Description**: The main container for all project-related activities, information, and financials, from the design phase through to the warranty period.
- **Example**: The project for the main client is named "Project - Sarah & Michael Westbrook". Another example from the list is "Project - Boutique Hotel Riviera".

<Info>
  **Pro Tip: Expanding Your Project Blueprint**

  The current Project Management blueprint is streamlined for clarity. As your operational complexity grows, you can easily expand it by adding more specialized `🧊 Objects` to manage finer details. For example, you could add:

  - `🧊︎ Construction Category` and `🧊︎︎ Task` sub-objects to create a detailed work breakdown structure (WBS) for each project.
  - `🧊 Material` objects to track the procurement lifecycle for all necessary equipment and supplies.
  - `🧊 Construction Log` objects for daily on-site progress and issue tracking.

  This modular approach allows you to build a system that is as simple or as detailed as your business requires.
</Info>

### 2. 🧊︎ Construction Category (Sub-Object)

- **Process Description**: Manages a major work package within a `🧊 Project`, such as electrical, plumbing, or furniture installation. It groups related tasks together.
- **Parent Object**: `🧊 Project`
- **Example**: "Electrical Work" for Project P-101. "Furniture & Decor" for Project P-101.
