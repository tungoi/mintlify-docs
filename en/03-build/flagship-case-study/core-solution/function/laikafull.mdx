**From First Call to 'Closed-Won': A CRM Tailored for Interior Design**

<Info>
  This `üìã Function` template provides a complete Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system specifically for project-based businesses like architecture and interior design. It focuses on managing long sales cycles with multiple client touchpoints and ensures a perfect, automated handoff from the sales team to the project delivery team.
</Info>

**Why This Template Matters**
For an interior design business, a deal isn't just a transaction; it's a journey. This CRM is designed to manage that journey. It tracks every interaction‚Äîfrom the initial phone call to the critical site survey‚Äîas a distinct `Touchpoint`. This ensures that when a deal is won, your design and project teams receive a rich, detailed history of the client's needs, not just a name and a number.

**Key Outcomes You'll Achieve:**

- **Visualize Your Sales Pipeline:** Track every potential project (`Opportunity`) as it moves through a pre-configured, 5-stage visual pipeline from `Prospecting` to `Closed-Won`.
- **Log Every Client Interaction:** Record every call, email, meeting, and site survey as a `Touchpoint` `Sub-Object`, ensuring no detail is lost.
- **Automated Lead Assignment:** Automatically assign new leads to your sales team with a round-robin system to ensure fast follow-up.
- **Never Miss a Follow-Up:** Receive automatic alerts for deals that have stalled, prompting you to re-engage and maintain momentum.
- **Seamless Project Handoff:** The moment an `Opportunity` is won, an automation instantly creates a new `Project` for your delivery team, transferring all critical data.

## **Architectural Blueprint**

This template is built on a proven, AI-generated design that ensures scalability and efficiency for the interior design sales process. Below are its core technical components.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Entities & Relationships (Object Types)">
    <p>
    Objective: To establish a clear data model for managing clients, potential projects (Opportunities), and all related interactions (Touchpoints).</p>

    <ul>
    <li>
    üßä Kh√°ch h√†ng (Customer) [Standard Object]: The central entity for storing information about individuals or organizations. It acts as the primary record for all contact details and history.</li>

    
    <li>
    üßä C∆° h·ªôi (Opportunity) [Standard Object]: Represents a potential design and build project. It contains the deal's value, sales stage, and is always linked to a Customer.</li>

    
    <li>
    üßä ƒêi·ªÉm ch·∫°m (Touchpoint) [Sub-Object]: A child Object of an Opportunity. It is used to log every specific interaction, such as a phone call, a concept presentation, or a site survey, creating a detailed timeline of the sales process.</li>

    </ul>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Operational Flow (Workflow)">
    <p>
    Objective: To guide a potential project (Opportunity) through a standardized sales funnel, ensuring consistent process and accurate forecasting.</p>

    
    **Opportunity Object Workflow:**
    `Prospecting` ‚Üí `Qualification` ‚Üí `Proposal/Design` ‚Üí `Negotiation` ‚Üí `Closed-Won` / `Closed-Lost`.

    - Each stage is a distinct step in the sales cycle. The `Proposal/Design` stage is critical for interior design firms and is explicitly included.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Key Automations">
    <p>
    Objective: To eliminate manual tasks, ensure data integrity, and accelerate the sales cycle from lead to project handoff.</p>

    <ul>
    <li>
    Lead Assignment: Automatically assigns new Customer Objects (in "Lead" state) to sales reps using a round-robin mechanism.</li>

    
    <li>
    Stale Opportunity Alert: If an Opportunity has no new Touchpoint logged for 14 days, an alert is automatically sent to the Sales Manager.</li>

    
    <li>
    Project Creation on "Closed-Won": When an Opportunity status changes to Closed-Won, this automation automatically creates a new Project Object in the Project Management Function and links it to the Customer.</li>

    </ul>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
