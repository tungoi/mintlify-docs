### **Relationships & References between Object Types (M·ªëi quan h·ªá & tham chi·∫øu gi·ªØa c√°c Lo·∫°i vi·ªác)**

This section defines the three ways `Object Types` in the Design Function connect with each other and with other functions: hierarchical parent-child links, peer-to-peer connections, and specific field-level references.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Parent-Child Relationships">
<p>This defines the hierarchical structure where creative deliverables are nested under a main `Design` Object.</p>

| Parent-Child Relationship | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Design` => `Concept` | The Concept is the first stage of the overall design process. |
| `Design` => `3D` | 3D development begins after the Concept is completed. |
| `Design` => `2D` | 2D technical drawings are derived from the 3D model. |
| `Design` => `Revision` | Revisions and adjustments are based on client feedback. |

</Tab>
<Tab title="Object Connections">
<p>These are direct, peer-to-peer connections that link the `Design` Function to other key business functions.</p>

| Connection Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Design Support:** `Design` <=> `Site Survey` | The `Design` Object receives critical information from the results of a completed `Site Survey` Object. |
| **Design Collaboration:** `Design` <=> `Project` | The `Design` Object is a key component of the overall `Project` management process. |

</Tab>
<Tab title="Object Fields">
<p>These are specific `Data Fields` that allow users to link individual `Objects` together, with filtering conditions to ensure data accuracy.</p>

| Field | Reference Details | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| _Design_ / **Related Survey** | **References:** `Site Survey` Object <br/> **Displays Fields:** `Type`, `Location`, `Survey Results` <br/> **Filter Condition:** `Status = "COMPLETED"` | References the completed site survey to pull in key information for the design process. |
| _Design_ / **Main Project** | **References:** `Project` Object <br/> **Displays Fields:** `Project Name`, `Client`, `Timeline` <br/> **Filter Condition:** `Status != "CANCELLED"` | Links the design work to the main project for overall progress tracking. |

</Tab>
</Tabs>

### **Reports & Analytics (B√°o c√°o & Ph√¢n t√≠ch)**

The function includes two pre-configured dashboards for real-time visibility into the design process and team workload.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Design Phase Dashboard" icon="chart-pie-simple" iconType="duotone">
    Provides a project-level view of the design process, showing the status of all creative `Sub-Objects` (`Concept`, `2D`, `3D`, etc.) for a given project in one place.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Designer Workload Report" icon="person-digging" iconType="duotone">
    A report that shows how many deliverables each `Designer` is actively working on, helping managers balance workload and prevent bottlenecks.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### **Key Automations (T·ª± ƒë·ªông h√≥a ch√≠nh)**

These automations are crucial for maintaining process consistency and reducing administrative overhead.

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Automation 1: Standard Deliverable Creation" icon="layer-group" iconType="duotone">
    **Trigger:** When a new `Design` `Object` is created.

    <br />

    **Action:** Automatically create the four standard `Sub-Objects` (`Concept`, `2D Drawing`, `3D Render`, `Material Board`) and link them to the parent `Design` `Object`.

    <br />

    **Purpose:** Ensures every project starts with the same consistent set of required deliverables, eliminating manual setup.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automation 2: Automatic Review Assignment" icon="user-magnifying-glass" iconType="duotone">
    **Trigger:** When a `Sub-Object`'s status is changed to `INTERNAL REVIEW`.

    <br />

    **Action:** Automatically assign the Manager of the user in the `Designer` field as a follower and @mention them in a comment to begin the review.

    <br />

    **Purpose:** Streamlines the internal review process and ensures managers are immediately notified when their input is required.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automation 3: Automated Client Notification" icon="paper-plane" iconType="duotone">
    **Trigger:** When a `Sub-Object`'s status is changed to `AWAITING CLIENT FEEDBACK`.

    <br />

    **Action:** The system sends a pre-formatted email to the client, including a secure link to view the file in the `Presentation File` field.

    <br />

    **Purpose:** Standardizes client communication and reduces the time designers spend writing emails.
