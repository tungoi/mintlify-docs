<Info>
  **Purpose:** This document defines the **internal** operational logic of the CRM (Business) `📋 Function`. It details the process from lead acquisition to deal closure and handover.
</Info>

## Why This Matters

<Check>
  This `📋 Function` transforms the lead management process from a manual, disconnected effort into a streamlined, automated revenue engine. From a strategic standpoint, it provides clear ROI tracking from ad spend to signed contracts. For the sales team, it eliminates guesswork by automating lead assignment, standardizing follow-up procedures, and integrating essential tools like Google Calendar, directly increasing conversion rates and team efficiency.
</Check>

## The Big Picture

<Info>
  Architecturally, this system is designed to capture leads from external webhooks (e.g., landing pages), process them through a structured pipeline using two core `🧊 Objects` (`🧊 Customer` and `🧊︎ Demo`), and then seamlessly hand off successful deals to downstream `📋 Functions` like Contracts and Site Surveys. It relies on both internal automations for efficiency and external API calls for calendar integration.
