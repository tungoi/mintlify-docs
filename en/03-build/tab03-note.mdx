## **TAB 3: SYSTEM DESIGN PHILOSOPHY**

_(This tab can be merged into "Luklak Platform \> Tier 1" or kept separate for more emphasis on philosophy. If kept separate, content will focus on "Why Luklak is designed this way" and benefits of that philosophy.)_

1. **"Unified & Universal" Philosophy: Foundation for Flexibility**
   - **JTBD:** _When I want to understand deeper about Luklak's vision and core differentiators, I want to know what the "Unified & Universal" philosophy means and what benefits it brings to building operational solutions._
   - **Key Takeaway:** "You will understand that Luklak's 'Unified & Universal' philosophy allows you to build a single operational system where all business processes are created from universal building blocks, providing superior flexibility, customization capability and data connectivity compared to packaged software."
2. **The Power of Nocode & Lowcode: Empowering Everyone**
   - **JTBD:** _I want to know how Luklak enables non-coders to still build applications, and when people with technical knowledge can intervene more deeply, to understand the platform's capabilities._
   - **Key Takeaway:** "You will see Luklak empowers business users to build solutions with drag-and-drop interfaces (Nocode), while providing Lowcode tools for experts to solve complex requirements, creating perfect balance."
3. **Three-Tier Architecture: From Concept to Operations**
   - **JTBD:** _I want an overview of how Luklak's components connect with each other, from foundational LEGO blocks, to Function design, and finally how users work daily, to understand the big picture of the system._
   - **Key Takeaway:** "You will visualize Luklak's 3-tier architecture: (1) Foundational LEGO Blocks creating flexibility, (2) Function Design packaging business logic, and (3) Deployment as Spaces for end users to Use and Operate."
4. **Comparing Luklak with Traditional Solutions**
   - **JTBD:** _When I'm considering between Luklak and other packaged software (e.g., dedicated CRM, project management software), I want a clear comparison of pros and cons, to make an appropriate decision._
   - **Key Takeaway:** "You will see Luklak's superior advantages in customization, integration capability, and long-term ownership costs compared to traditional packaged software solutions, as well as cases where Luklak is the optimal choice."
