### ### **Understanding the Kanban Board**

As you saw in the tutorial, the Kanban board has two main parts:

- **Columns:** Each column represents a status or a stage in a process (e.g., `To Do`, `In Progress`, `Done`). Your manager sets these up for the team.
- **Cards:** Each card is a single `ðŸ§Š Object`â€”like a task, a lead, or a support ticket. The card shows you the most important information at a glance.

### ### **Key Actions**

You'll mostly be doing two things in the Kanban view:

1. **Drag and Drop:** This is the fastest way to update your work. When you start working on a task, drag its card from `To Do` to `In Progress`. When youâ€™re finished, drag it into `Done`. Itâ€™s that easy\!
2. **Click a Card:** If you need to see all the details, add a comment, or attach a file to an `ðŸ§Š Object`, just click on its card. This will open the full detail view without you having to leave the board.

> **Quick Tip:** Use the **Quick Filter Bar** at the top of the page to see only the cards that are assigned to you. This helps you focus on your personal to-do list\!
