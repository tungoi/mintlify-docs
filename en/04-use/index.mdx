**Welcome to Your Daily Guide**

<Info>
The guides in this section are your go-to resource for day-to-day work in Luklak. They are short, simple, and focused on helping you complete a single task quickly and efficiently.

We assume your system has already been built by your manager or a system architect. If you're interested in learning how to *build* a system like this, please see **Tab 3: Build Playbooks**.
