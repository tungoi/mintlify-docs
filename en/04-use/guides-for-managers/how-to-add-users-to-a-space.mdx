This guide will show you how to invite members to a `‚èπÔ∏è Space` and assign them the correct role. We'll follow Manager Mai at LAIKA as she adds a new designer to her "Active Projects" space.

# Tutorial: Adding Members to a Space

## Section 1: Accessing Space Settings

1.  **Navigate to Your `‚èπÔ∏è Space`**: First, go to the `‚èπÔ∏è Space` where you want to add a new member. In this case, we'll go to the `Active Projects` space.

2.  **Open Space Settings**: In the top right corner of the space, click the **Settings** (gear) icon to open the configuration panel for that specific space.

1.  **Go to the 'Members' Tab**: In the settings panel, find and click on the "Members" tab. You'll see a list of everyone who currently has access.

3.  **Find and Select Users**: Start typing the name of the person you want to add. Select them from the list. You can add multiple people at once.

4.  **Assign a Role**: This is a critical step. From the "Role" dropdown, select the level of access they should have. For a new designer, the **'Member'** role is usually appropriate.

### Quick Tip: Understanding Roles in a `‚èπÔ∏è Space`

Choosing the right role is key to keeping your space organized and secure.

  - **Admin**: Can change `‚èπÔ∏è Space` settings, manage members, and configure `Workviews`. Best for team leads or project managers.
  - **Member**: Can create, edit, and comment on `üßä Objects`. Cannot change space settings. Perfect for most team members.
  - **Viewer**: Can only view `üßä Objects` and read comments. Cannot create or edit. Great for clients or stakeholders from other departments who need visibility but shouldn't make changes.

**What's Next?**

Now that your team has access, you'll want to be able to report on their work. The next guide will show you how to build a simple report to track team progress.
