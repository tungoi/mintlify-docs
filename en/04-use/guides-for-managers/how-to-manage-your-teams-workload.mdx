**Balancing the Work**

<Info>
A key part of a manager's job is ensuring work is distributed evenly so that no one is overloaded and projects stay on track. Luklak provides powerful `Workviews` to help you see who is working on what at a glance, identify potential bottlenecks, and rebalance the workload with a simple drag-and-drop.

This guide will show you how to create and use a "Workload View." We'll follow Manager Mai at LAIKA as she reviews her design team's active `Deliverables`.

## **Creating a "Team Workload" View**

Our goal is to create a single screen that groups all active tasks by the person they are assigned to, making it easy to see each team member's plate.

# Tutorial: Creating a Team Workload View

## Section 1: Building the Grouped View

1.  **Navigate to Your `‚èπÔ∏è Space`**: Start in the `Active Projects` `‚èπÔ∏è Space` where your team's work is managed.

2.  **Create a New 'List' View**: In the sidebar, click the `+` next to the `Workviews` list and select **List** as the view type. Name it "Team Workload".

3.  **Set the `Object` Type**: In the view's configuration, make sure you are showing the correct `üßä Object`. For the LAIKA design team, we will select the `Deliverable` object.

4.  **Apply the 'Group By' Setting**: This is the most important step. At the top of the view, click the **"Group by"** button and select the **`Assigned To`** field from the list.

5.  **View the Result**: The list will instantly transform into a grouped view, with a clear section for each team member and the `Deliverables` assigned to them.

6.  **Filter for Active Work**: To make the view cleaner, click the **"Filter"** button and add a condition to hide completed tasks: `Status` **is not** `APPROVED`.

7.  **Save the View**: Click the dropdown next to the view name and save it so your team can access it with one click in the future.

## Section 2: Using the View to Manage Work

1.  **Assess the Workload**: You can now clearly see how many `Deliverables` are assigned to each person. In our example, you might see that one designer has 7 tasks while another only has 2, indicating an imbalance.

2.  **Reassign with Drag-and-Drop**: To rebalance the work, simply **click and drag** a `Deliverable` from the overloaded designer's group to another designer's group. The `Assigned To` field for that `Deliverable` will be updated automatically. It's that easy.

3.  **Drill Down for Details**: If you need more context on a specific task before reassigning it, simply click on its title to open the full `Object` detail view.
