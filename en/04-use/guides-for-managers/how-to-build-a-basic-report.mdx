**Getting a Quick Overview**

<Info>
Keeping track of your team's progress is essential for effective management. While full, cross-functional dashboards are powerful, sometimes you just need a quick, simple chart within your `‚èπÔ∏è Space` to answer a specific question like, "What's the status of all our active work right now?"

This guide will show you how to build a basic report directly within your team's workspace. We'll follow Manager Mai at LAIKA as she creates a pie chart to see the current status of all active `Design Concepts`.

## **Creating a "Design Status Overview" Chart**

Our goal is to create a live pie chart that automatically shows how many design tasks are in each stage of the workflow (`IN PROGRESS`, `IN REVIEW`, etc.).

# Tutorial: Building a Simple Chart

## Section 1: Accessing the Reporting Area

1.  **Navigate to Your `‚èπÔ∏è Space`**: Start in the `Active Projects` `‚èπÔ∏è Space` where your team does their work.

2.  **Find or Create a Dashboard View**: In the list of `Workviews` for your space, look for a "Dashboard" or "Reporting" view. Click on it. If one doesn't exist, you can create a new `Workview` and select the "Dashboard" type.

## Section 2: Building Your Chart Gadget

1.  **Add a Gadget**: On the dashboard screen, click the `+ Add Gadget` button. This is how you add new charts, tables, and metrics to your report.

2.  **Select the "Chart" Gadget**: From the list of available gadgets, choose **Chart**.

3.  **Configure the Data Source**:
    - First, tell the chart what data to use. In the "Search for" field, select the `Design Concept` `üßä Object`.

4.  **Choose the Chart Type**:
    - For this report, a **Pie Chart** is a great way to see the distribution of statuses. Select "Pie Chart" from the options.

5.  **Set the "Group By" Field**:
    - This is the most important step. In the configuration panel, find the "Group by" (or "Labels") field and select **`Status`**. This tells the chart to create a slice for each status in your workflow.

6.  **Save the Gadget**: Give your chart a clear name like "Current Design Statuses" and click "Save".

## Section 3: Viewing Your Live Report

1.  **See Your Chart in Action**: That's it! Your dashboard now contains a live, interactive pie chart. It will update automatically in real-time as your team updates the status of their `Design Concepts`. You can hover over any slice to see the exact count.
