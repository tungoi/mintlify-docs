**Showing Your Progress**

<Info>
As you work, it's crucial to keep your team and the system updated. Updating an `ðŸ§Š Object` is how you show your progress, share new information, and keep everything in sync.

In this guide, we'll show you two key actions: how to **edit the details** of an `Object`, and how to **move it to the next stage** in its `Workflow`. We'll follow a designer at LAIKA who has just finished a new design concept.

## **Updating Your `Design Concept`**

Let's say you are a designer at LAIKA and you've just finished the first version of a kitchen mockup for a client. It's time to update the system.

# Tutorial: Updating Your Work

## Section 1: Editing a Field

1.  **Open the `Object`**: First, find and click on the `ðŸ§Š Object` you want to update from your `Workview`. In this example, we'll open the "Client Hoai An - Kitchen Mockup V1" `Design Concept`.

2.  **Click to Edit**: To change any piece of information, simply click on its field. Let's update the `Design File` by uploading the latest version from our computer.

3.  **Changes are Saved Automatically**: Upload your new file. Most fields in Luklak save instantly as soon as you click away, so there's no need to look for a save button.

## Section 2: Changing the Workflow Status

1.  **Locate the Workflow Bar**: At the top of the `Object` screen, you'll see the current process, or `Workflow`. This `Design Concept` is currently in the `IN PROGRESS` stage.

2.  **Click the Next Stage**: Since the design work is done, it's ready for a manager's review. Click on the next stage in the process: `IN REVIEW`.

3.  **Confirm the Change**: That's it! The `Object` has now moved to the `IN REVIEW` stage. The status is highlighted in a new color, and the system automatically logs this change in the activity history. Your manager may also be notified automatically.

## Section 3: Add a Comment (A Best Practice)

1.  **Go to the Chat Section**: It's always a good idea to add a comment to provide context for your update. Scroll down to the `Chat` section at the bottom.

2.  **@mention Your Manager**: Write a clear message and @mention your manager to ensure they see it. For example: "@Mai, the first version of the kitchen mockup is uploaded and ready for your review!"
