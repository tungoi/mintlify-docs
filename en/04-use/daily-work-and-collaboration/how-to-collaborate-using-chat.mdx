**Keeping Conversations Organized**

<Info>
Clear communication is key to great teamwork. Luklak is designed to keep all your conversations organized and in the context of your work, so you never have to ask "Where did we talk about that?" again.

This guide will explain the two main places you can chat with your team: directly on a work item (**`Object Chat`**) and in your team's general channel (**`Space Chat`**).
</Info>

### **`Object Chat`: For Conversations About Specific Work**

Think of `Object Chat` as the comment section for a specific task. It's the best place for any discussion related to **that single piece of work**.

**Scenario:** A Project Manager at LAIKA needs to give feedback on a specific `Design Concept`.

1.  She opens the `üßä Object` for the "Client Hoai An - Kitchen Mockup V1".
2.  She scrolls to the bottom to find the **`Chat`** section.
3.  She writes a message and **@mentions** the designer to make sure he gets a notification.

The biggest advantage is that this conversation is now **permanently attached to the history** of this design. Anyone can look back months from now and understand the context behind the decisions made.

### **`Space Chat`: For General Team Announcements**

Think of `Space Chat` as your team's main group chat room. It's for conversations that apply to the whole team or project, not just one specific task.

**Scenario:** The lead designer at LAIKA wants to share an inspiring article with the entire design team.

1.  She navigates to the `Design Team` `‚èπÔ∏è Space`.
2.  She clicks on the main **`Chat`** tab for the space.
3.  She posts a message for the whole team to see.

This is the perfect place for team-wide announcements, general questions, or sharing information that doesn't belong to any single work item.
