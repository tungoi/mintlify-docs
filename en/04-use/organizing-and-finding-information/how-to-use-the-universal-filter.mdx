**Finding Exactly What You Need**

<Info>
What if you need to find work based on more than just its title? For example, "Show me all approved designs from last month" or "Find all projects assigned to me that are over budget."

For these deeper, more specific questions, you'll use the **Universal Filter**. This guide will show you how to build a precise query to find exactly what you're looking for across your entire workspace.

## **Finding All "Approved" Designs by a Specific Designer**

Let's imagine a manager at LAIKA needs to find all the final, approved designs created by a specific team member, Duc.

2.  **Start Your Query**: This will take you to the Universal Filter page, which allows you to build a query from scratch.

## Section 2: Building Your Query

1.  **Select the `Object` Type**: First, tell the system what you're looking for. From the "Search for" dropdown, select the `Design Concept` `ðŸ§Š Object`.

2.  **Add Your First Condition**: Now, let's add the criteria. Click "Add Condition" and set it to:
    `Status` **is** `APPROVED`.

3.  **Add a Second Condition**: Click "Add Condition" again. Make sure the logic between the two conditions is set to **AND**. Set the new condition to:
    `Assigned To` **is** `Designer Duc`.

4.  **Execute the Search**: Click the "Search" button. The system will now display a list of every `Design Concept` `ðŸ§Š Object` in the entire workspace that matches **both** of your precise criteria.
