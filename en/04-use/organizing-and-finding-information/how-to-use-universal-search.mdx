2.  **Click to Navigate**: From here, you can click on any result to jump directly to that `üßä Object`.

## Pro-Tips for Title Searching

- **Use Quotation Marks for Exact Phrases**: Searching for `"Kitchen Mockup V1"` will only return objects with that exact phrase in the title.
- **Search by ID**: Every `üßä Object` has a unique ID (e.g., `PROJ-17`). If you know the ID, typing it into the search bar is the absolute fastest way to find a specific item.

**What's Next?**

Simple search is great for finding things by name. But what if you need to find work based on other criteria, like who it's assigned to, its status, or a due date? For that, you'll need the Universal Filter.
