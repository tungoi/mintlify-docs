**Creating Your Perfect View**

<Info>
Feeling overwhelmed by long lists of work? The key to staying focused is to create your own personalized views that show you **only** what you need to see, exactly when you need to see it.

This guide will teach you how to use three powerful tools‚Äî**Filter**, **Sort**, and **Save View**‚Äîto take control of your workspace. We'll follow a salesperson at LAIKA who wants to create a custom view of their most important deals.

## **Creating a "My High-Value Deals" View**

Our goal is to create a view that shows only the deals that are assigned to me, are worth more than $10,000, and are still active. Then, we'll sort them by their close date.

# Tutorial: Creating a Custom Saved View

## Section 1: Filtering Your Data

1.  **Start in Your `‚èπÔ∏è Space`**: Navigate to the `Sales & CRM` `‚èπÔ∏è Space` and open the main `Opportunity` `Workview`. You'll see all opportunities for the whole team.

2.  **Open the Filter Menu**: Click the `Filter` button at the top of the view to open the configuration menu.

3.  **Add Filter Conditions**: We'll add three conditions to see only the work we want.
    - **Condition 1**: `Assigned To` **is** `Current User`. (This is a special value that means "me").
    - **Condition 2**: Make sure the logic is set to **AND**, then add `Project Value` **is greater than** `10000`.
    - **Condition 3**: Add another **AND** condition: `Status` **is not** `WON` **AND** `Status` **is not** `LOST`.

4.  **Apply the Filter**: Click "Apply". The list will instantly update to show only the `üßä Objects` that match all your criteria.

## Section 2: Sorting Your View

1.  **Open the Sort Menu**: Now that the list is filtered, let's sort it. Click the `Sort` button.

2.  **Set the Sort Order**: Let's put the most urgent deals at the top. Set the sort order to: **`Estimated Close Date` - `Ascending`**. This puts the soonest dates first.

## Section 3: Saving Your Custom View

1.  **Find the "Save" Option**: You've created the perfect view, but you don't want to set this up every day. At the top of the screen, the view name now has an asterisk (*), showing it has unsaved changes.

2.  **Save As New View**: Click the dropdown arrow next to the view name and select **"Save as new view"**.

3.  **Name Your View**: Give your view a clear, descriptive name, like "My High-Value Deals", and click "Save".

4.  **Get One-Click Access**: That's it! Your new custom view now appears in the `‚èπÔ∏è Space`'s sidebar under its own name. You can now get back to this exact filtered and sorted list with a single click, anytime.
