**Welcome to Luklak!**

<Info>
This short guide will give you a tour of your new digital workspace. Think of it as the orientation for your new digital office. We'll use the LAIKA company workspace as our example to show you around and get you comfortable with the main screen.
</Info>

### **The Three Main Zones**

When you first log in, the screen is divided into three main zones. Understanding these zones is the key to navigating Luklak with confidence.

### **1. The Sidebar: Your Navigation Hub**

The dark sidebar on the left is your main tool for moving between different parts of the company.

- **`üìÇ Areas`**: Think of these as large folders for different departments. In the LAIKA workspace, you can see `üìÇ Areas` for `Sales`, `Project Delivery`, and `Finance`.
- **`‚èπÔ∏è Spaces`**: These are the actual workspaces where teams collaborate. Inside the `Project Delivery` `üìÇ Area`, you'll find the `Active Projects` `‚èπÔ∏è Space`. This is likely where you'll do most of your daily work.

### **2. The Main Work Area: Where Work Happens**

This large, central part of the screen is where you see and interact with your work. We call this a `Workview`.

- **View Controls**: At the top of the work area, you'll see controls like `Filter`, `Sort`, and `Group by`. These let you customize how your work is displayed.
- **`üßä Objects`**: Each item in the list (or card on a board) is a single piece of work, which we call an `üßä Object`. For example, one `üßä Object` might be a `Design Concept` you need to work on, while another might be a `Client Meeting` to attend.

### **3. The Top Navigation Bar: Your Tools**

The bar at the very top of the screen contains your personal tools and settings.

- **Universal Search**: The search bar is the fastest way to find anything‚Äîa specific project, a client's name, or a document.
- **Notifications**: The bell icon is your personal inbox for important updates and mentions from your team.
- **Your Profile**: Click on your avatar to access your personal settings, change your password, or log out.

**What's Next?**

Now that you've had a high-level tour of the workspace, let's zoom in and learn about the most important part of your daily workflow: the `üßä Object`.
