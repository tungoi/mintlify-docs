**Your Digital Index Card**

<Info>
Think of an `ðŸ§Š Object` as a smart, digital index card for a single piece of work. Whether it's a client deal, a design task, or a project, everything you need to know about it lives on this one screen.

This guide will walk you through the different parts of an `Object` screen, using a sales **`Opportunity`** from the LAIKA system as our example.

### **The `Object` Screen: A Visual Breakdown**

When you click on any `ðŸ§Š Object`, you'll see a detailed view like the one below. We can break it down into three main areas: the **Details**, the **Workflow Status**, and the **Activity History**.

### **1. The Main Details: Key Information at a Glance**

The top section of the screen contains the most important data fields for the object. This is where you find the core facts about the work item.

- **`Opportunity Name`**: The title of the work.
- **`Project Value`**: A key financial number.
- **`Assigned To`**: The person responsible for this `Opportunity`.
- **`Estimated Close Date`**: The deadline or target date.
- **`Related Contact`**: A link to the main client contact associated with this deal.

### **2. The Workflow Status: Where is this in the process?**

Just below the title, you'll see a visual representation of the business process, or `Workflow`. The highlighted step shows you the object's current stage.

- You can see this LAIKA `Opportunity` is currently in the **`PROPOSAL SENT`** stage.
- When the work is done and you're ready to move it forward, you will simply click on the next stage in the workflow (e.g., `NEGOTIATION`).

### **3. Activity & Chat: The Full History**

The bottom section is a complete, chronological log of everything that has ever happened to this `Object`. It is the "single source of truth" that ensures everyone is on the same page.

- **Activity**: The system automatically logs important changes, like "System updated Status from `CONSULTING` to `PROPOSAL SENT`."
- **Chat**: This is where your team collaborates. You can see comments, ask questions, and @mention teammates to get their attention, keeping all communication in the context of the work itself.

**What's Next?**

Now that you understand the layout of your workspace and how to "read" a work item, it's time to learn how to create your own.
