## Section 2: Filling in the Details

1.  **Open the Create Form**: Clicking `+ Create` will open a new form to enter information.

2.  **Select the `Object` Type**: If your `‚èπÔ∏è Space` has more than one type of `üßä Object`, make sure to select the correct one. In this case, we'll choose `Lead`.

3.  **Fill in the Fields**: Fill in the important details for the new lead, like `Full Name`, `Email`, and `Lead Source`. Fields marked with an asterisk (*) are required.
