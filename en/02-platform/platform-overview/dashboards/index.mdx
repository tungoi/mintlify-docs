## Beyond the To-Do List: From Execution to Analysis

Managing your daily work is critical, and that's the job of `Workviews`. They provide the lists, boards, and timelines you need to interact with and progress your individual `ðŸ§Š Objects`.

But to truly improve your business, you need to step back and see the big picture. You need to identify trends, spot bottlenecks, and measure performance. This requires a different toolâ€”not for *doing* the work, but for *analyzing* it. That tool is the **Dashboard**.

## Workview vs. Dashboard: The Critical Difference

Understanding the distinction between a `Workview` and a `Dashboard` is key to using Luklak effectively.

  <Card title="Workview (The Workshop)" icon="screwdriver-wrench" iconType="duotone">
    **Purpose:** **Execution.** A Workview is where you actively work on `ðŸ§Š Objects`â€”updating fields, dragging cards, and moving work forward.
    <br/><br/>
    **Focus:** A list of **individual work items**.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Dashboard (The Control Tower)" icon="chart-line" iconType="duotone">
    **Purpose:** **Analysis.** A Dashboard aggregates, calculates, and visualizes data from many `ðŸ§Š Objects` to provide insights.
    <br/><br/>
    **Focus:** **Summaries and trends** of work items.

## The Power of a Unified Data Source

In traditional software, building a dashboard that combines data from different departments (like Sales and Operations) requires a complex, costly, and slow ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process.

Because all data in Luklak is built on the `ðŸ§Š Universal Object`, our dashboards can instantly query and aggregate data from any `Function` or `Space` across the entire system. Your "Sales" data and "Project" data already speak the same language. This allows you to build truly cross-functional dashboards in minutes, not months.

## A Glimpse of the Possibilities

You build your dashboards by adding and arranging various **gadgets**, each designed to present data in a specific way. These include powerful tools like:
- **Charts** (Pie, Bar, Stacked Bar)
- **Counters & Formulas**
- **1D & 2D Statistics Tables**
- **Live Object Lists**
