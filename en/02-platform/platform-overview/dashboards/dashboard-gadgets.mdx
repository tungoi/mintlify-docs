## The Building Blocks of Your Dashboard

A **gadget** is a specific, configurable widget that you place on your dashboard to visualize a set of data. Your dashboard is a canvas, and gadgets are the powerful tools you use to paint your data story.

This guide serves as a reference library for all the standard gadget types available in Luklak, explaining the purpose and best use case for each.

## Charts

Charts are the best way to visualize proportions, comparisons, and trends in your data. You typically configure a chart by grouping your `üßä Objects` by a `Select List`, `User`, or `Status` field.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Pie Chart">
    **Best for:** Showing proportions and the percentage breakdown of a whole.

    <br />

    **Business Question:** "What is the breakdown of our sales pipeline by `Stage`?" or "What percentage of our support tickets are `High Priority`?"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Bar Chart">
    **Best for:** Comparing values across different categories.

    <br />

    **Business Question:** "How many `Tasks` are currently assigned to each team member?" or "Which marketing channels are generating the most `Leads`?"
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Stacked Bar Chart">
    **Best for:** Comparing values across categories, while also showing the composition of each bar.

    <br />

    **Business Question:** "How many tasks does each team member have, and what is the `Priority` breakdown for each person?"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Statistics Tables

Statistics Tables are powerful tools for creating summary reports in a pivot-table-like format. They are ideal for analyzing the distribution of work across two dimensions.

- **1D Statistics Table:** Groups `üßä Objects` by **one** criterion to create a simple summary table.
  - **Business Question:** "Show me a count of all `Support Tickets`, grouped by their `Status`."
- **2D Statistics Table:** Groups `üßä Objects` by **two** criteria simultaneously, creating a matrix.
  - **Business Question:** "Show me a count of all `Support Tickets`, with `Priority` as the rows and `Assignee` as the columns. This helps identify if one person is overloaded with high-priority tickets."

## Counters & Formulas

This gadget is for displaying a single, important number or calculated result.

- **Counter:** The simplest gadget. It displays a real-time count of `üßä Objects` that match your UQL query.
  - **Use Case:** A large number showing the "Total Open Bugs" or "Deals Closed This Quarter."
- **Formula:** Allows you to perform calculations on aggregated data.
  - **Use Case:** Use two different counters to calculate a conversion rate: `(Count of 'Deals Won' / Count of 'All Deals') * 100` to show your overall "Win Rate %".

## Object List

Sometimes the most important thing is not a chart, but a direct view of the work itself. This gadget allows you to embed a filtered list of key `üßä Objects` directly onto your dashboard.

- **Use Case:** On a Project Manager's dashboard, alongside charts showing overall progress, include an `Object List` gadget that shows "All `üßä Tasks` with a `Status` of `BLOCKED`" for immediate action.

## Activity Feed

This gadget embeds a real-time activity stream from a selected data source directly into your dashboard view, allowing users to track updates and take action in real time.

- **Use Case:** On a team's dashboard, include an `Activity Feed` for their specific `‚èπÔ∏è Space` so everyone can see the latest comments, status changes, and file attachments without leaving the dashboard.
