## Beyond Static Reports: A Living Dashboard

A Luklak Dashboard is not just a static image of your data; it's a living, interactive workspace. It's designed for you to explore, question, and act on your data in real time without needing to ask for a new report.

This guide covers the two primary ways you can interact with any dashboard: **Filtering** to focus your view, and **Drilling Down** to see the details behind the numbers.

## Filtering Your View with Quick Filters

The **Quick Filter Bar** is a set of easy-to-use controls, typically located at the top of your dashboard, that allows you to instantly narrow down the data displayed across all gadgets on the page.

- **How it Works:** The dashboard's creator pre-configures relevant filters (like `Date Range`, `Assignee`, or `Project`). You can simply select options from these dropdowns to focus your analysis on what matters to you at that moment.
- **Use Case:** On a "Company Health" dashboard, a CEO can use the `Date Range` Quick Filter to switch from viewing "This Quarter's" data to "Last Quarter's" data. All the charts and counters on the dashboard will update instantly to reflect the new time period.

## Drilling Down: From Insight to Action

This is the most powerful interactive feature of a Luklak Dashboard. Every number and chart segment is a clickable gateway to the underlying data. This is called "drilling down."

- **How it Works:** Simply **click on any data point**â€”a slice of a pie chart, a bar in a bar chart, or a number in a counter gadget.
- **The Result:** Clicking will open a new view showing a filtered list of the **`exact ðŸ§Š Objects`** that make up that specific piece of data. In one click, you've moved from the "what" (the analysis) to the "who" and "which" (the actual work items).

<Tip>
  This feature allows you to go from a high-level insight (e.g., a chart shows "We have 5 blocked tasks") directly to the source ("Here are those 5 specific tasks") in a single click, so you can review the details and take immediate action.

## What's Next?

You have now mastered how to view, analyze, and interact with your data using Workviews and Dashboards. The next step is to learn about the powerful language that makes all of this possible.
