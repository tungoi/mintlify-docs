## Before You Begin

This tutorial will walk you through the process of building a simple "Sales Performance" dashboard from scratch.

<Info>
  **Prerequisite:** This guide assumes you have a `Function` (e.g., "Sales CRM") and a `Space` with some sample `ðŸ§Š Deal` Objects. Your `Deal` Object Type should have fields like `Deal Value` (Number), `Stage` (Select List), and `Owner` (User).
</Info>

Remember, a **Dashboard** is for **analysis**. We are now going to aggregate the data from many individual `ðŸ§Š Deal` Objects to see the big picture.

## The 3 Levels of Data Scoping

Before building, it's important to understand how Luklak handles data sources. You can define a data scope at three cascading levels:

1. **Dashboard-Level Source:** Set a default data source for the **entire dashboard** (e.g., "All data from the Sales CRM Function").
2. **Page-Level Source:** Override the dashboard source for a **specific page** (e.g., "Page 2 only shows data from the Enterprise Deals Space").
3. **Gadget-Level Source:** Override all other sources for a **single gadget**.

<Tip>
  For maximum flexibility, most users set data sources at the **Gadget Level**. This allows you to have a gadget for "Sales Deals" right next to a gadget for "Support Tickets" on the same page. This tutorial will follow that approach.

# Building a Sales Performance Dashboard
This guide walks you through creating a simple dashboard with two common gadgets: a Counter and a Pie Chart.

## Section 1: Create Your New Dashboard
1.  Navigate to the main **Dashboards** area in your sidebar.
2.  Click the **'+ New Dashboard'** button.
    ![Screenshot showing the main dashboards page with the '+ New Dashboard' button highlighted.](/images/dashboards/tutorial-step1.png)
3.  Give your dashboard a name, like "Sales Performance Q3", and click **'Create'**.
    * You will be taken to a new, empty dashboard canvas, ready for your gadgets.

## Section 2: Add a 'Deal Count' Counter
* Tip: Counters are great for showing a single, important, at-a-glance number.

1.  On the empty canvas, click **'+ Add Gadget'**.
2.  Select the **'Counter'** gadget from the library.
3.  In the gadget's configuration panel, set the **Data Source**. Use UQL to define what you want to count.
    * For this example, let's count all open deals: `object.type = "Deal" AND status.category = "ACTIVE"`
    ![Screenshot of the Counter gadget configuration, with the UQL query being entered.](/images/dashboards/tutorial-step2.png)
4.  Give the gadget a title: "Total Active Deals".
5.  Click **'Save'**. The counter will appear on your dashboard.

## Section 3: Add a 'Pipeline Stage' Pie Chart
* Tip: Pie charts are perfect for showing the proportional breakdown of your data.

1.  Click **'+ Add Gadget'** again.
2.  Select the **'Chart'** gadget and choose the **'Pie'** type.
3.  Set the **Data Source** to count all your active deals: `object.type = "Deal" AND status.category = "ACTIVE"`
4.  In the **'Group By'** setting, select your 'Stage' field (`stage`). This tells the chart how to slice the pie.
    ![Screenshot of the Pie Chart gadget configuration, showing the Data Source and the 'Group By' setting selected.](/images/dashboards/tutorial-step3.png)
5.  Give the gadget a title: "Active Pipeline by Stage".
6.  Click **'Save'**.

## Section 4: Arrange Your Dashboard
1.  You can now **drag and drop** your gadgets on the canvas to arrange them.
2.  You can also **resize** them by dragging their corners to get the perfect layout.
