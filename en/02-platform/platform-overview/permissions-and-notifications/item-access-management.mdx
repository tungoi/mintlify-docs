## The Key to Your Buildings

<Info>
  After a user enters the platform with their **Business Privilege** (Layer 1), the next layer of security determines what they can interact with. This is **Item Access Management**.
</Info>

If a Business Privilege is the ID badge that gets a user onto the campus, Item Access Management provides the specific keys to each building on that campus.

<Card title="Item Access Control" icon="key" iconType="duotone">
  The granular permission system that controls who can view, use, edit, or manage a specific "Item" (like a `Function` or `Dashboard`).
</Card>

## What is an "Item"?

This is a critical distinction. In the context of Item Access Management, an "Item" is a high-level, structural component of your system, **not** the individual `üßä Objects` (like tasks or deals) that your team works on day-to-day. Access to those is handled by Layer 3: Permission Schemes.

<Info>
  Item Access Management gives you contextual control over the containers, blueprints, and shared resources that define your workspaces.
</Info>

The following "Items" include a built-in access control mechanism:

- `üìã Functions`
- `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces`
- `üìÇ Areas`
- `üë• Groups` (Controlling who can manage the group's membership)
- `Dashboards`
- `Saved Filters`

## Item Permission Levels

When you grant a User or Group access to an Item, you assign them one of three permission levels.

<Warning>
  **Crucial Distinction:** These Item-level roles (`Admin`, `Manager`, `Member`) are assigned **per Item** and are completely separate from a user's system-wide `Business Privilege`. For example, a user can be a `Member` of the system but an `Admin` of a specific `Dashboard`.
</Warning>

- **Admin:** Full control over the Item. An `Admin` can manage the Item's content, settings, and its access controls (i.e., they can add or remove other Admins, Managers, and Members).
- **Manager:** Can manage the Item's content and settings but **cannot** change its access controls. For example, a `Manager` of a `Dashboard` can add or remove charts, but cannot change who is allowed to see that `Dashboard`.
- **Member:** Can view or use the Item but cannot change its content or settings. This is the standard "read-only" or "user-level" access.

## How to Manage Item Access

<Tip>
  As a best practice, we recommend assigning access to `Groups` whenever possible, rather than to individual `Users`. If a team member's role changes, you only need to update their Group membership, and all their Item Access permissions will update automatically.
</Tip>

# Tutorial: Setting Access on a Function

! Important: You must have the appropriate Business Privilege (e.g., Admin or App Manager) and `Admin`-level access on an Item to change its permissions.

## Section 1: Locate the Item

1.  **Navigate to the Item's Location**
    For this example, go to `Global Settings` > `Functions` to see the list of all Functions in your system.

2.  **Find the Access Control**
    Hover over the `Function` you wish to secure and click the `...` (More actions) menu. Select `Access Control`.

## Section 2: Assign Permissions

1.  **Add a User or Group**
    In the Access Control panel, click `Add People`. Search for and select the `User` or `Group` you want to add.

2.  **Set the Permission Level**
    Once added, choose the level of access from the dropdown next to their name: `Admin`, `Manager`, or `Member`.

3.  **Confirm Changes**
    The permissions are saved and take effect immediately.
```

## What's Next?

Now that you can control access to the "buildings" on your campus, it's time to manage the rules inside them.
