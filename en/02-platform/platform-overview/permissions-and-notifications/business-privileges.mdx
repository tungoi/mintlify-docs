## Your Ticket to the Platform

**Business Privilege** is the first and most important layer in Luklak's security model. Think of it as a user's passport or campus ID badge‚Äîit determines if they are allowed to enter the system at all and defines their maximum, unchangeable authority across the entire platform.

<Info>
  Every account, whether it's a `User account` or a `Functional account`, must be assigned one of the four Business Privileges. This is a global setting that precedes all other permissions.

## The Four Privilege Levels

There are four distinct levels of Business Privilege, each designed for a specific scope of responsibility.

  <Card title="Owner" icon="crown" iconType="duotone">
    The single highest authority. The Owner can manage billing, transfer ownership of the entire instance, and holds all permissions of the Admin role. There can only be one Owner.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Admin" icon="user-gear" iconType="duotone">
    A system administrator with full configuration power. Admins can manage all users, groups, roles, global settings, and have the ability to access and configure any part of the platform.
  </Card>
  <Card title="App Manager" icon="map" iconType="duotone">
    A specialized builder role. App Managers can design, create, edit, and manage `üìã Functions`. This role is ideal for solution architects or department heads who build and maintain processes without needing full admin rights like user management.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Member" icon="user" iconType="duotone">
    The standard privilege for most team members. Members can work within the `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces` and `üßä Objects` they are granted access to via Layer 2 and Layer 3 permissions, but they cannot access global settings or design `üìã Functions`.

## How to Assign and Manage Privileges

Assigning a Business Privilege is a high-level administrative action.

<Warning>
  Assigning `Owner` or `Admin` privileges grants extensive control over your entire Luklak instance. Grant these privileges with caution and only to trusted personnel.
</Warning>
