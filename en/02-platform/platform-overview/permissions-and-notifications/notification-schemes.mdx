## Smart Alerts, Not More Noise

In a busy work environment, too many notifications create noise, causing team members to miss the updates that truly matter. The key to effective collaboration isn't more alerts, it's smarter alerts.

**Notification Schemes** are Luklak's solution for intelligent alert management. They run in parallel with `Permission Schemes` to control who gets notified when specific actions occur, ensuring the right people get the right information at the right time.

<Info>
  A Notification Scheme is a reusable set of rules, defined in a `ðŸ“‹ Function`, that determines who gets an alert when a specific action happens to an `ðŸ§Š Object`.
</Info>

## How Notification Schemes Work

Notification Schemes use the same powerful "Action -\> Recipient" logic as Permission Schemes. However, their purpose is different:

- **Permission Schemes** ask: "Is this `Recipient` **allowed** to perform this `Action`?"
- **Notification Schemes** ask: "When this `Action` occurs, which `Recipients` should be **informed** about it?"

This separation is powerful. For example, a project manager may not have permission to transition a task to `DONE`, but a Notification Scheme can ensure they are always alerted the moment a team member does.

## Built-in Schemes for Common Use Cases

To get you started quickly, Luklak provides four pre-configured Notification Schemes that cover the most common communication patterns.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="1. Notify all actions to all viewers" icon="volume-high" iconType="duotone">
    The "loudest" setting. Every action on any `Object` (edits, new messages, etc.) sends a notification to everyone who can view that `Object`. Best for small, highly-engaged teams where everyone needs to know everything.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Notify all actions to direct assignees" icon="volume-low" iconType="duotone">
    More focused. Every action on an `Object` sends a notification, but only to the people directly assigned to that `Object` (e.g., in the "Assignee" or "Reviewer" fields).
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Notify key actions to direct assignees" icon="bell-on" iconType="duotone">
    A balanced default. Only important actions (like status changes, @mentions, or new messages) will trigger notifications, and only for the direct assignees. This reduces noise from minor edits.
  </Card>
  <Card title="4. Notify key actions to key assignees" icon="bell-slash" iconType="duotone">
    The "quietest" setting. Only the most important actions trigger notifications, and only for key `Roles` like "Manager" or "Approver", not every single assignee. Ideal for high-level oversight.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Creating a Custom Notification Scheme

When you need more precise control, you can build your own Notification Scheme from scratch. The process is nearly identical to creating a `Permission Scheme`.

<Tip>
  Custom schemes allow for powerful workflows. For example, you can create a rule that when an `Object`'s `Priority` field is set to "Critical", a notification is automatically sent to the "Senior Leadership" `Group`.

# Tutorial: Creating a Custom Notification Scheme

! Important: You must have the appropriate Business Privilege (e.g., Admin) to create and manage global Notification Schemes.

## Section 1: Create the Scheme

1.  **Navigate to Notification Schemes**
    Go to `Global Settings` > `Permissions & Notifications` > `Notification Schemes`.

2.  **Create New Scheme**
    Click `Create New Scheme` and give it a descriptive name.

## Section 2: Build Your Notification Rules

1.  **Add Your First Rule**
    In the scheme editor, click `Add Rule`.

2.  **Define the Action and Recipient**
    First, select an **Action** that will serve as the trigger (e.g., `Create Object`). Then, select the **Recipients** who should receive an alert when this action happens (e.g., the `Role` "Project Manager").

3.  **Save the Scheme**
    Continue adding rules as needed. When finished, save the scheme. It is now available to be selected in the settings of any `ðŸ“‹ Function`.
```

## What's Next?

You have now mastered Luklak's complete governance framework. You can confidently control who can perform actions and who gets notified, creating secure and efficient workflows.
