## The Rules Inside the Building

This is the final and most granular tier of Luklak's security model. You have your campus ID (`Business Privilege`) and the key to a specific building (`Item Access`). Now, **Permission Schemes** define the rules _inside_ that building. They control who can perform specific actions on the individual `üßä Objects` within a `‚èπÔ∏è Space`.

Permission Schemes are reusable sets of rules, typically defined within a `üìã Function`, that automatically apply to all `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces` created from that Function. This ensures that your business processes are executed consistently and securely.

## The Anatomy of a Permission Scheme

Every rule within a Permission Scheme answers the fundamental question: "**Who** can do **what**?" It achieves this by connecting a specific **Recipient** (the "who") to a specific **Action** (the "what").

### Available Actions

These are the operations that users can perform on `üßä Objects` and `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces` which you can grant or deny permission for:

- **Space Actions:** View Space
- **Object Actions:** View, Create, Delete, Edit, Transition Status
- **Assignment Actions:** Assign Users, Set Dates, Link Objects
- **Communication Actions:** Send Messages, Delete Messages, Add/Remove Attachments

### Available Recipients

These are the different ways you can define "who" gets the permission. This flexibility allows for incredibly powerful and dynamic security models.

- **Roles:** The most flexible method. Grant permission to an abstract `Role` like "Project Manager" or "Approver". You then map actual users to that Role in each `‚èπÔ∏è Space`.
- **Specific Users & Groups:** The most direct method. Grant permission to a named person or a predefined `Group` (e.g., "Finance Department").
- **Dynamic User & Group Fields:** The most powerful method for object-level security. Grant permission to the user(s) or group(s) listed in a field _on the Object itself_. For example, only the person listed in the `Assignee` field can edit the `Object`.
- **Special Recipients:** Includes the `Creator` of the `Object` and `All members` of the business.

## Built-in Schemes for Quick Setup

For common scenarios, Luklak provides four pre-configured Permission Schemes you can apply to any `üìã Function` for rapid setup.

<Check>
  - **Fully open:** All business members can view the `Space` and all `Objects` inside. Only people directly assigned to an `Object` can update it.
  - **Broad access:** All `Roles` within the `Space` can view the `Space` and all `Objects` inside. Only direct assignees can update an `Object`.
  - **Moderate restriction:** All `Roles` can view the `Space`, but only people directly assigned to an `Object` can view or update it.
  - **Strict access:** All `Roles` can view the `Space`, but only direct assignees can view an `Object`, and only key assignees can update it.

## Creating a Custom Permission Scheme

When the built-in options aren't enough, you can design your own scheme with precise rules.

```guidejar
# Tutorial: Creating a Custom Permission Scheme

! Important: You must have the appropriate Business Privilege (e.g., Admin) to create and manage global Permission Schemes.

## Section 1: Create the Scheme

1.  **Navigate to Permission Schemes**
    Go to `Global Settings` > `Permissions & Notifications` > `Permission Schemes`.

2.  **Create New Scheme**
    Click `Create New Scheme`. Give it a descriptive name, like "Strict Financial Approval Scheme".

## Section 2: Build Your Rules

1.  **Add Your First Rule**
    In the scheme editor, click `Add Rule`. This opens the rule builder.

2.  **Define the Action and Recipient**
    First, select an **Action** from the dropdown (e.g., `Transition Status`). Then, select one or more **Recipients** who are allowed to perform this action (e.g., the `Role` named "Finance Approver").
    ![The rule builder interface showing a user selecting the "Transition Status" Action and assigning it to the "Finance Approver" Role.](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x600.png/000000/FFFFFF?text=Step%202:%20Configure%20Rule)

3.  **Continue Adding Rules**
    Continue adding rules for every action you want to control. Any action without a rule will be denied by default.

4.  **Save the Scheme**
    Once finished, save the scheme. It is now available to be selected in the settings of any `üìã Function`.


    
```

## What's Next?

You have now mastered all three layers of permission control. The final piece of the governance puzzle is managing how your team is notified of actions.
