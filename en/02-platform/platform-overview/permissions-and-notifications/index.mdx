## Security Meets Collaboration

The central challenge in any powerful business system is balancing two critical needs: protecting sensitive information and enabling seamless collaboration. Systems that are too open are a security risk. Systems that are too locked down create friction and slow down work.

Luklak solves this with a sophisticated, multi-layered security model. It's designed to give you precise control over who can see and do what at every level of the platform, from the entire system down to a single field on an individual `üßä Object`.

## The 3 Layers of Control

To understand how security works, think of your Luklak instance as a secure corporate campus. To do any work, a person must pass through three distinct levels of security checks.

<Info>
  This model ensures that permissions are always explicit. A user must have the right credentials at all three layers to perform an action, providing comprehensive and predictable security.

### Layer 1: Business Privilege - Your Campus ID Badge

This is the highest and most fundamental level of access. A user's **Business Privilege** determines if they are allowed onto the campus at all and defines their maximum potential authority. It's the first gate everyone must pass.

<Card title="Layer 1: Business Privilege" icon="user-shield" iconType="duotone">
  Defines a user's system-wide status, such as **Owner, Admin, App Manager,** or **Member**. Without this "ID badge," a user cannot enter the system.
</Card>

### Layer 2: Item Access - The Key to a Building

Once a user is on campus, `Item Access Management` determines which specific buildings they can enter. In Luklak, "buildings" are high-level components like a `üìã Function`, a `Dashboard`, or a top-level `üìÇ Area`.

<Card title="Layer 2: Item Access" icon="key" iconType="duotone">
  Controls who can view or manage the containers of work. Your campus ID gets you in, but you still need the specific keycard to enter the "Finance Department" building.
</Card>

### Layer 3: Permission Schemes - The Rules Inside the Building

Once inside a specific building (like a `‚èπÔ∏è Space` created from a `Function`), **Permission Schemes** govern what a user can actually do. This is the most granular layer of control, defining specific actions on the data within.

<Card title="Layer 3: Permission Schemes" icon="file-invoice" iconType="duotone">
  Controls actions on individual `üßä Objects`. Can you read the files on the desk (`View Object`)? Can you write on the whiteboard (`Edit Object`)? Who gets an alert when you do?
</Card>

## How The Layers Interact

A user's effective permissions are the result of all three layers working together. A user must have the required access at each level to perform an action. For example, a user might be an **Admin** (Layer 1) and have access to the "Recruitment" `Function` (Layer 2), but a `Permission Scheme` (Layer 3) on a `‚èπÔ∏è Space` for "Executive Hires" could still prevent them from seeing `üßä Objects` related to confidential candidates.

This layered approach provides a powerful and flexible security framework that can be adapted to any business process.
