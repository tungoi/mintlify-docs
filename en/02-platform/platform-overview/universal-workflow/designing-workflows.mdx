## Before You Begin

This tutorial will walk you through designing your first simple workflow. We will create a standard `TO DO` → `IN PROGRESS` → `DONE` lifecycle, which is the foundation for countless business processes.

<Info>
  **Prerequisite:** This guide assumes you have already created a `Function` and an `Object Type` named "Task". If you haven't, please follow our [Creating Your First Object Type](/platform/core-concepts/universal-object/creating-object-types) guide first.
</Info>

You are now acting as the architect, defining the official path that all "Task" Objects must follow. A clear workflow is the foundation of a predictable and reportable process.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Creating a 'Task' Workflow

# Designing a Basic 'Task' Workflow
This guide walks you through creating a simple but essential three-step workflow on the visual canvas.

## Section 1: Accessing the Workflow Canvas
! Important: Make sure you are inside the design canvas of a `Function` and have selected the "Task" `Object Type` you created previously.

1.  From the left sidebar of the Function designer, ensure you are on the **'Object Types'** tab and that your "Task" `Object Type` is highlighted.

2.  Click on the **'Workflow'** sub-tab. This will open the visual workflow canvas where you will design the process.
    * The canvas may be empty or contain a single default status.

## Section 2: Creating Your Statuses
* Tip: Each status represents a key stage in your process. For clarity and system-wide consistency, it's a best practice to name your statuses in `UPPERCASE`.

1.  If there is a default status on the canvas, click on it to open its settings, and rename it to `TO DO`.
2.  Click the **'+ Add Status'** button on the canvas to create a new status. Name it `IN PROGRESS`.
3.  Click **'+ Add Status'** again and name the final status `DONE`.

## Section 3: Defining the Transitions
* Tip: Transitions create the 'flow' in your workflow. They define the permitted paths an Object can take, preventing steps from being skipped.

1.  Hover over the `TO DO` status. Click the small `+` icon on its right edge and, while holding the mouse button, drag the arrow to the `IN PROGRESS` status. Release the mouse button to create the transition.
2.  Now, hover over the `IN PROGRESS` status. Click the `+` icon on its right edge and drag the arrow to the `DONE` status.
3.  Review your workflow. You should now have a clear, linear flow: `TO DO` → `IN PROGRESS` → `DONE`.

```

## Your First Workflow is Ready\!

Congratulations\! You have now successfully designed a complete, logical workflow. Every "Task" `Object` created from this `Object Type` will now be bound to this exact `TO DO` → `IN PROGRESS` → `DONE` lifecycle.

This simple act enforces your business process, ensures data consistency for reporting, and makes the status of every task instantly understandable.

## What's Next?

A workflow is more than just boxes and arrows. The next step is to learn about the properties and rules that give your statuses power and intelligence.
