## Why Workflows Matter

In any business, processes that exist only "in people's heads" are inconsistent, difficult to track, and impossible to automate or report on. To scale your operations, you must make your processes explicit, visual, and executable.

Luklak's **Workflow** engine is a powerful visual tool that allows you, the architect, to do just that. It lets you design a clear, standardized lifecycle for any `Object Type`, bringing clarity, consistency, and control to every business operation.

## The Core Components

Every `Workflow` in Luklak is built from two simple, powerful components:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Status" icon="flag" iconType="duotone">
    A `Status` represents a specific step, stage, or state in your process. It is a snapshot in the lifecycle of an `Object`. Examples include `NEW`, `IN REVIEW`, `APPROVED`, or `COMPLETED`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Transition" icon="arrows-left-right" iconType="duotone">
    A `Transition` is the defined, one-way path between two `Statuses`. It controls how and when an `Object` can move from one step to the next, enforcing the correct order of operations.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## How It All Fits Together

Understanding the hierarchy of these components is key to designing effective processes:

1. You first design a **`Workflow`** by arranging `Statuses` and connecting them with `Transitions`.
2. This `Workflow` is then assigned to a specific **`Object Type`** (e.g., the "Sales Deal" blueprint).
3. This design work all happens inside the canvas of a **`üìã Function`**.
4. When users create live **`Objects`** (e.g., a specific "Q4 Sales Deal") inside a `‚èπÔ∏è Space`, those Objects are now bound to follow the exact workflow you designed.

<Info>
  By defining the process at the `Object Type` level, you ensure that every single "Sales Deal" follows the same approved sales process, guaranteeing consistency and providing reliable data for reporting and automation across the entire team.
