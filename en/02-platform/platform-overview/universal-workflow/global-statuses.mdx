## The Challenge of Scale: Process Inconsistency

As your organization scales and you build dozens of `ðŸ“‹ Functions`, a new challenge emerges: process inconsistency. The Sales team might use a `COMPLETED` status, while the Support team uses `RESOLVED`, and the Finance team uses `PAID`. While each makes sense in context, this lack of a common language makes cross-functional reporting difficult and creates ambiguity about the true state of work.

## The Solution: A Central Library of Statuses

Luklak solves this challenge with **Global Statuses**, a central library in `Global Admin` where you can create and manage a standardized set of statuses for your entire organization.

<Tip>
  Think of it as creating an official "process dictionary" for your company. You define what `APPROVED` means onceâ€”including its name and `Status Category`â€”and then everyone uses that same standard definition, ensuring the entire business is speaking the same language.
</Tip>

### How Global Statuses Work

The process is simple and powerful:

1. **Create in Global Admin:** An administrator with the correct `Business Privilege` accesses the Global Admin section to create new statuses. For each global status, you define its `Name` (e.g., `AWAITING_REVIEW`) and assign it to one of the six system `Status Categories` (e.g., `ACTIVE`).
2. **Import into a Workflow:** When designing a `Workflow` inside a `Function`, instead of creating a new status from scratch, you can simply **"Import from Global Library."** This pulls the pre-defined, standardized status directly into your workflow canvas.

[Guidejar Placeholder: A two-part tutorial. Part 1 shows an Admin creating a new Global Status called 'PENDING_LEGAL' in the Global Admin panel. Part 2 shows a Function designer opening a workflow canvas and using the 'Import from Global' button to add that 'PENDING_LEGAL' status to their workflow.]

## The Strategic Benefits

Adopting a global management strategy provides three critical benefits for any large-scale deployment:

- **Unified Process Language:** Everyone in the company understands what `ON_HOLD` means, regardless of the department. This eliminates ambiguity.
- **Rapid Workflow Design:** Architects can build new workflows much faster by pulling from a pre-approved library of standard statuses instead of recreating them each time.
- **Reliable Cross-Functional Reporting:** This is the most significant advantage. Because the status is a standardized global component, you can build a single `Dashboard` gadget to count all Objects across the entire company that are currently in the `AWAITING_REVIEW` status. This is impossible when every team uses a different name for the same step.
