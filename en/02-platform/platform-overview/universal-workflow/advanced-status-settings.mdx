## Beyond the Flowchart

A workflow's true power lies not just in its path, but in the rules and logic embedded at each step. Advanced Status Settings transform a simple flowchart into an intelligent, secure, and automated business process.

<Info>
  These settings are configured by clicking on a `Status` within the workflow design canvas. They add layers of control over the transition _into_ that status.

This guide covers the three main types of advanced settings you can configure on any `Status`.

## 1. Conditions: The Gateway to a Status

**Conditions** act as a smart gateway that an `Object` must pass through to enter a status. If the combined conditions are not met, the user is blocked from making the transition. You can set two types of conditions—Data Validation and User Permissions—and combine them for powerful control.

### Condition Type: Data Validation

This checks the data _on the Object_ itself before allowing the transition.

- **Use Case:** Prevent a `Contract` from moving to `SENT_FOR_SIGNATURE` unless the `Contract Value` field is filled out AND the `Legal Approval Checklist` is 100% complete.
- **What you can validate:** `Data Fields` (e.g., not empty), `Checklists` (e.g., completion %), `Sub-objects` (e.g., all sub-tasks are `DONE`), and more.

### Condition Type: User Permission

This checks _who the user_ attempting the transition is, acting as a secure approval gate.

- **Use Case:** Ensure that only a user with the 'Manager' `Role` can move a `Purchase Request` to the `APPROVED` status.
- **Who you can grant permission to:** `User accounts`, `Groups`, `Roles`, and users listed in `User Fields` (like 'Assignee' or 'Supervisor').

<Tip>
  By creating multiple transitions out of a single status, each leading to a different next status with its own unique condition, you can create dynamic routing. For example, a `REVIEW` status could have a transition to `APPROVED` (if `Score` \<= 8) and another to `NEEDS_REWORK` (if `Score` \> 8).
</Tip>

## 2. Input Screens: Collecting Data in Context

An **Input Screen** is a form that automatically pops up when a user transitions an Object _into_ this status, requiring them to fill in specific fields before the transition is complete.

- **Use Case:** When a support ticket is moved to the `CLOSED` status, an Input Screen appears that requires the agent to fill out the `Resolution Summary` and `Time Spent` fields.
- **Why it's useful:** It ensures you collect the right data at the right time, improving data quality and saving users from having to remember to go back and fill in details later.

## 3. Workflow Automation: Triggering Actions

You can attach a series of automated actions that fire the moment an `Object` successfully enters a status.

- **Use Case:** When a `Candidate` Object enters the `HIRED` status, a workflow automation can instantly:
  1. Create a new `Object` in the 'Employee Onboarding' `Function`.
  2. Update the 'Onboarding Task' `Assignee` field to the HR team.
  3. Send a pre-written welcome email to the candidate.
- **Note:** This is a specific type of automation tied directly to the workflow. The main `Universal Automation` engine allows for even more complex rules that can run in the background or be triggered by other events.

## What's Next?

You now have the tools to build secure, intelligent, and automated workflows. The next step is to learn how to analyze their performance.
