## The Architect's Choice: When to Use a Data Table

Imagine you need to model a one-to-many relationship, like an `ðŸ§Š Invoice` that has many `ðŸ§Š Line Items`. Should those `Line Items` be `Sub-Objects`, or something else?

This is a critical architectural decision. The **`Data Table`** field is the "something else"â€”a powerful tool designed for modeling **contained** relationships.

<Tip>
  **`Use a Data Table`** when the "many" items are simple rows of data that belong exclusively to the parent and **`do not need to live as independent ðŸ§Š Objects`**. Examples: line items, meeting action items, expense logs.

  **`Use Parent-Child Sub-Objects`** when the child items are complex entities that need their own detailed workflow, permissions, and history. Examples: a `ðŸ§Š Project` and its `ðŸ§Š Tasks`.

## What is a Data Table Field?

The `Data Table` field is essentially a **`mini-spreadsheet embedded directly within a single ðŸ§Š Object`**. It allows you to manage structured lists of data without having to create dozens of separate, simple `ðŸ§Š Objects`.

As an architect, you predefine the **columns** of the table. Each column acts like its own mini data field, with types like `Text`, `Number`, `Date`, or even `Formula`.

## Key Capabilities

The Data Table is more than a simple list; it has two standout features that enable highly advanced solutions.

### 1. Cross-Object Data Referencing

A column in your table can be configured to **`look up and pull in data from another, separate ðŸ§Š Object`**.

- **`Use Case (Students & Classes):`** In a `ðŸ§Š Class` Object, you can have a Data Table of attendees. One column could be an `Object Picker` that allows you to select `ðŸ§Š Student` Objects. Other columns in the same row can then automatically pull in data like the selected student's `Student ID` and `Contact Email` directly from their `ðŸ§Š Student` Object, creating a dynamic class roster.

### 2. Combining with Automation

The Data Table becomes a dynamic, interactive system when combined with `Universal Automation`. Actions within the table can trigger rules that affect other `ðŸ§Š Objects`.

- **`Use Case (Inventory & Sales):`** An `ðŸ§Š Order` Object has a Data Table for its line items. When the sales team adds a row, selects an `ðŸ§Š Inventory Item`, and enters `Quantity = 10`, an automation rule can be triggered. This rule finds the referenced `ðŸ§Š Inventory Item` and executes an action to decrease its `Stock Level` field by 10 in real-time.
