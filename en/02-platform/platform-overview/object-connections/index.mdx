## Why Object Connections Matter

<Info>
  A business isn't a collection of disconnected lists; it's a web of interconnected relationships. A `Customer` is linked to their `Projects`, which are linked to `Tasks`, which are linked to `Invoices`. Modeling these real-world connections is the key to breaking down data silos.
</Info>

<Tip>
  Luklak's Object Connection capabilities allow you to build this 360-degree view of your operations. By linking Objects, you can automate across processes, create powerful cross-functional reports, and give your team the full context they need to make smart decisions.

## Four Ways to Model Relationships

Luklak provides four distinct tools for modeling relationships, each suited for a different architectural need. Understanding when to use each is the key to designing an effective and scalable system.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Parent-Child Relationships" icon="sitemap" iconType="duotone">
    **What it is:** A built-in, strict hierarchy between a standard `Object` and its `Sub-Objects`.

    <br />

    **Best for:** Work breakdown structures, like a `Project` containing many `Tasks`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Object Lookup Fields" icon="magnifying-glass-plus" iconType="duotone">
    **What it is:** A flexible field that allows one `Object` to reference one or more other `Objects`.

    <br />

    **Best for:** Creating direct, many-to-one references, like linking a `Support Ticket` to a `Customer`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Global Connections" icon="globe" iconType="duotone">
    **What it is:** A centrally-managed library of reusable relationship _types_ (e.g., "duplicates," "is blocked by").

    <br />

    **Best for:** Standardizing the _meaning_ of relationships across your entire system.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Table Fields" icon="table" iconType="duotone">
    **What it is:** An embedded "spreadsheet" within an `Object` for managing structured lists of data.

    <br />

    **Best for:** Modeling "contained" one-to-many data, like the line items on an `Invoice`.
