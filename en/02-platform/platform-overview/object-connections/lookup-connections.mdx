## What is an Object Picker Field?

While the parent-child connection creates a strict hierarchy, the **`Object Picker`** field is designed for creating **flexible, non-hierarchical references** between Objects. It allows one `Object` to point to one or more other `Objects` anywhere in the system, providing valuable context.

<Tip>
  Think of it like citing sources in a research paper. A `ðŸ§Š Project` Object can "cite" or "reference" a `ðŸ§Š Customer` Object and a `ðŸ§Š Contract` Object. These referenced Objects don't belong to the project; they are independent entities that are simply being pointed to for context.
</Tip>

This reference is created by adding a specific type of `Data Field` to your `Object Type`'s `Data Screen`.

## Key Characteristics

- **Flexible & Non-Exclusive:** This is the key difference. The referenced `Objects` are independent. A single `ðŸ§Š Customer` can be referenced by many different `ðŸ§Š Projects`, `ðŸ§Š Support Tickets`, and `ðŸ§Š Invoices` simultaneously. The referenced `Object` doesn't "belong" to the `Object` that is referencing it.
- **Configurable:** As an architect, you add this reference just like any other `Data Field`. This means you can make it required, add help text, and control its visibility.
- **Highly Specific:** The most powerful feature of the `Object Picker` is the ability to **pre-filter the choices** available to the end-user. You can use UQL to ensure users can only select from relevant `Objects` (e.g., "only allow selecting `ðŸ§Š Customers` in an `ACTIVE` status").

## Field Types

There are two types of `Object Picker` fields to choose from, depending on your architectural need:

- **`Single Object Picker:`** Used for many-to-one or one-to-one relationships. For example, a `ðŸ§Š Support Ticket` can reference only one `ðŸ§Š Customer`.
- **`Multiple Objects Picker:`** Used for many-to-many relationships. For example, a `ðŸ§Š Marketing Campaign` could reference multiple targeted `ðŸ§Š Customer Segments`.

## How to Create an Object Picker Reference

1. **Navigate to Data Fields:** Inside a `ðŸ“‹ Function`, select the `Object Type` you want to add the reference to (e.g., `ðŸ§Š Support Ticket`) and go to its `Data Fields` section.
2. **Add a New Field:** Click `+ Add Field` to create a new `Data Field`.
3. **Choose the Type:** Select `Single Object Picker` or `Multiple Objects Picker` from the field type dropdown.
4. **Configure the Filter (Optional but Recommended):** In the field's settings, use UQL to define which `Objects` a user is allowed to select from. This ensures data integrity by preventing users from picking irrelevant items.

## Common Use Cases

- Associating a `ðŸ§Š Support Ticket` with the specific `ðŸ§Š User` who reported it and the `ðŸ§Š Product` it relates to.
- Referencing the `ðŸ§Š Meeting` where a `ðŸ§Š Project Task` was discussed.
- Selecting multiple `ðŸ§Š Author` Objects on a `ðŸ§Š Blog Post` in a co-authoring scenario.

## What's Next?

You now know how to create both strict hierarchies and flexible references. The next level of relationship modeling is to standardize the _meaning_ of these connections across your entire organization.
