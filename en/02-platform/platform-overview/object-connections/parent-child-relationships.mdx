## What is a Parent-Child Relationship?

The parent-child relationship is a special, built-in connection in Luklak designed for creating **strict, nested hierarchies**. It is the primary method for breaking down large pieces of work or complex entities into smaller, manageable parts.

<Tip>
  Think of it like a folder and its files on a computer. A `Project` (the parent folder) can contain many `Tasks` (the child files). Each `Task` file belongs exclusively to that one `Project` folder and cannot exist on its own.
</Tip>

This connection is automatically established when you define one `Object Type` as a **`Sub-Object`** of another **`standard Object Type`**.

## Key Characteristics

This relationship type has unique properties that make it perfect for hierarchical structures:

- **Built-in & Automatic:** You don't need to add a special field to create this link. The connection is automatically managed by the system as soon as you designate an `Object Type` as a `Sub-Object` of another.
- **Strict Hierarchy:** A `Sub-Object` (the child) is tightly coupled to its parent. It can only have **one** parent and cannot exist independently without being linked to that parent `Object`.
- **Exclusive by Design:** This connection is used _exclusively_ for the relationship between a standard `Object Type` and its designated `Sub-Object Types`. It cannot be used to link two unrelated standard `Object Types`.

## How to Create a Parent-Child Relationship

The relationship is defined during the design of your `Object Types` within a `üìã Function`.

1. **Define the Parent:** First, ensure you have a standard `Object Type` created (e.g., "Project").
2. **Define the Child:** When you create your second `Object Type` (e.g., "Task"), you will find a setting to designate it as a `Sub-Object`. When you enable this, you must select its `Parent Object Type` (in this case, "Project").
3. **The Link is Established:** Once this is saved, the hierarchical link is permanently defined. In any `‚èπÔ∏è Space`, when a user views a "Project" `Object`, they will see a dedicated section for creating and managing its child "Task" `Objects`.

## Common Use Cases

This connection type is the ideal choice for any scenario that requires a clear work breakdown structure or a nested hierarchy.

<Info>
  **Architect's Tip:** Choose the parent-child relationship when the child item **cannot and should not exist independently** of the parent. If the items can exist on their own and just need to reference each other flexibly, an [Object Lookup Field](/platform/core-concepts/object-connections/lookup-connections) is a better choice.

You've mastered strict, hierarchical relationships. Now, let's explore how to create more flexible, non-hierarchical connections between Objects.
