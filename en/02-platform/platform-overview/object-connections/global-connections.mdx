## Beyond Simple References

An `Object Picker` field is excellent for creating a simple referenceâ€”it says, "this `ðŸ§Š Object` is related to that one." But what if you need to define the **nature** of that relationship?

- Is this `ðŸ§Š Bug` a **duplicate of** that one?
- Is this `ðŸ§Š Task` **blocked by** that `ðŸ§Š Dependency`?
- Is this `ðŸ§Š Risk` **mitigated by** that `ðŸ§Š Control Measure`?

Without a standard way to define these relationships, their meaning is lost, and you cannot build advanced logic or reports based on them.

## The Solution: A Global Library of Relationship Types

A **Global Connection** is a centrally managed, reusable relationship *type* that you define in `Global Admin`. It allows you to give a specific name, meaning, and direction to the connection between two `ðŸ§Š Objects`.

<Tip>
Think of it like grammar. An `Object Picker` is a noun pointing to another noun ("Task" â†’ "Dependency"). A `Global Connection` adds the verb, creating a full sentence: "**`ðŸ§Š Task` *is blocked by* `ðŸ§Š Dependency`**." This adds a rich layer of semantic meaning to your data.

### How Global Connections Work

The process is managed by an administrator, ensuring system-wide consistency:

1.  **Define the Connection Type Globally:** In `Global Admin`, you create a new Connection Type. You give it a name (e.g., "Blocking") and define the forward and backward relationship text (e.g., "is blocked by" / "blocks").

2.  **Define the Rules:** You can also specify which `Object Types` are allowed to use this connection. For example, the "Duplicates" connection might only be permitted between two `ðŸ§Š Bug Report` Objects.

3.  **Use it on an Object:** Once defined, users with the right permissions can open an `Object` (e.g., a `ðŸ§Š Task`) and use the "Add Connection" feature to create a "Blocking" connection to another `ðŸ§Š Task`.

[Guidejar Placeholder: A two-part tutorial. Part 1 shows an Admin in Global Admin creating a new Connection Type called 'Blocking'. They set the forward name to 'is blocked by' and the backward name to 'blocks'. Part 2 shows a user on a 'Task' Object using the 'Add Connection' feature to select the 'Blocking' type and reference another 'Task' Object.]

### The Strategic Advantage

For architects, Global Connections unlock a more advanced level of system design:

- **System-Wide Clarity:** Everyone uses the same vocabulary for relationships, eliminating ambiguity.
- **Advanced Reporting:** You can run powerful queries like, "Show me all `ðŸ§Š Tasks` that are currently blocked by an `IN_PROGRESS` `ðŸ§Š Task`" or "Find all `ðŸ§Š Bugs` that have more than three 'duplicates' connections."
- **Powerful Automation:** Automations can be triggered by the creation of a specific connection type. For example, "When a 'duplicates' connection is added to a bug, automatically change the status of the duplicated bug to `CLOSED`."

## What's Next?

You have now mastered creating meaningful connections *between* different `ðŸ§Š Objects`. The final method of relationship modeling focuses on structuring data *within* a single `Object`.
