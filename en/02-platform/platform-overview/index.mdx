## Your Digital Universe

Think of your Luklak subscription as its own self-contained universe. We provide the fundamental laws of physics and a rich supply of raw materials, but you are the architect who shapes them into a thriving digital civilization.

This universe is governed by a simple yet powerful 2-phase architecture: you first establish the foundational rules, then you begin construction.

  <Card title="Phase 1: The Foundation" icon="landmark" iconType="duotone">
    This is where you establish the fundamental rules of your world. It involves setting up your people (`Users`, `Groups`, `Roles`) and defining the two critical layers of permission: high-level `Business Privileges` and granular `Item Access Control`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Phase 2: The Construction" icon="sitemap" iconType="duotone">
    This is where you build your operational solutions using the well-defined **3-Tier Architecture**. You use `Core Blocks` (materials) to design `Functions` (blueprints), which become live `Spaces` (buildings) where your team works.
