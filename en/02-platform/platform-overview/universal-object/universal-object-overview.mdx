**Why This Matters**

<Warning>
  In traditional software, your business is forced to adapt to the tool. A "deal" in a CRM is fundamentally different from a "task" in a project manager or a "ticket" in a helpdesk. This creates rigid silos, making it impossible to see the complete lifecycle of your work as it flows across departments.

  The `üßä Universal Object` breaks down these walls. It is a single, powerful abstraction that can be shaped to represent _any_ business entity‚Äîa customer, project, candidate, marketing campaign, or legal document. By building everything from this one common foundation, you create a truly unified system where data flows seamlessly and every process can connect to any other. This is the core principle that enables Luklak to be a single, fluid operating system for your entire business.

## **The Big Picture: From Abstract to Action**

The concept of the Universal Object is best understood as a three-stage journey from an abstract idea to a live piece of work:

1. **The Universal Object (The Core Concept)**
   This is the abstract, foundational "DNA" within the Luklak platform. It's not something you configure directly; it's the underlying principle that guarantees every piece of work, regardless of type, shares a common set of capabilities (like having a workflow, data fields, and the ability to be automated).
2. **The Object Type (The Blueprint)**
   This is where you, the architect, give the Universal Object a specific shape and purpose. Within a `üìã Function`, you define an **Object Type** (e.g., "Customer," "Marketing Campaign," "Bug Report"). You design its specific `Workflow` and attach the necessary `Data Fields`. The Object Type is the reusable blueprint for a specific business process.
3. **The Object (The Live Instance)**
   When a user creates an item inside a `‚èπÔ∏è Space`, they are creating an **Object**. This Object is a live, individual instance of the Object Type you designed. For example, "Acme Corp. Deal" is a single Object created from the "Sales Deal" Object Type. It moves through the defined workflow, contains specific data, and can be connected to other Objects across the platform.

This model allows for infinite customization at the design stage (Object Type) while ensuring universal compatibility and interoperability at the operational stage (Object).

## The Two Core Components: Workflow & Data Fields

Every `Object Type` you design is given its unique structure and logic by combining two essential components: its **Workflow** and its **Data Fields** (which are arranged on a `Data Screen`).

  <Card title="Workflow: The Process Lifecycle" icon="arrow-progress" iconType="duotone">
    The `Workflow` defines the lifecycle of your `Object Type`. It's a visual map of all the possible `Statuses` (e.g., `TO DO`, `IN PROGRESS`, `DONE`) and the `Transitions` (the allowed paths) between them. This is how you model and enforce your real-world business process.

  <Card title="Data Fields & Screen: The Information Structure" icon="pen-field" iconType="duotone">
    `Data Fields` are the custom fields you create to capture all the essential information (e.g., `Assignee`, `Due Date`, `Deal Value`). These fields are then arranged on a `Data Screen`, which acts as the visual form for creating and viewing the `Object`.

</CardGroup>

Together, these two components allow you to precisely define both the **process** an `Object` must follow and the **information** it must contain.
