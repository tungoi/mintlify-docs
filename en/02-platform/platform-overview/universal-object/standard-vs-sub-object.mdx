## The Two Levels of Objects

Not all work is a flat to-do list. Some initiatives are large and complex, requiring multiple levels of detail. To model this, Luklak allows you to define two levels for your `Object Types`: **Standard** and **Sub-Object**.

This structure is the foundation for creating the strict, built-in [Parent-Child Relationships](/platform/core-concepts/object-connections/parent-child-relationships) in your data model, which is the primary method for breaking down large pieces of work into smaller, manageable parts.

## Defining the Levels

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="üßä Standard Object" icon="cube" iconType="duotone">
    A **Standard Object** is a top-level, independent entity. It can exist on its own without needing a parent. Every hierarchy must start with a Standard Object.
    <br/><br/>
    **Examples:** `üßä Project`, `üßä Epic`, `üßä Customer Request`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="üßäÔ∏é Sub-Object" icon="cubes-stacked" iconType="duotone">
    A **Sub-Object** is a child entity that is nested *under* a Standard Object. It cannot exist on its own and is always part of a parent-child relationship. Its purpose is to break down the parent's work.
    <br/><br/>
    **Examples:** `üßä Task` (as a child of `üßä Project`), `üßä User Story` (as a child of `üßä Epic`).
  </Card>

## When to Use Sub-Objects: The Architect's Decision

Choosing to structure your `Object Types` as a Standard/Sub-Object hierarchy is a key architectural decision. This pattern is the ideal choice when:

- **The work has a natural hierarchy:** A `Project` is naturally composed of `Tasks`.
- **The child item cannot exist alone:** A `Task` without a `Project` is meaningless in this context. The child is fundamentally a component *of* the parent.
- **You need a true work breakdown structure:** This is the primary use case for tracking the completion of a larger initiative by measuring the progress of its constituent parts.

## How It Works in Practice

When you define this hierarchy in your `üìã Function`, it directly impacts the user experience in the `‚èπÔ∏è Space`:

- **Automatic Linking:** When a user creates a `üßä Task` (Sub-Object) from within a `üßä Project` (Standard Object), the two are automatically and permanently linked in a parent-child relationship.
- **Dedicated UI:** The parent `üßä Project` Object will have a built-in **"Sub-objects"** section in its detail view. This is where users can see, manage, and create all of its child `üßä Tasks` in one convenient place.

<Info>
**Architect's Tip:** If the "child" item can and should exist independently, a flexible [Object Picker Field](/platform/core-concepts/object-connections/object-picker-fields) is a better choice for creating the relationship.
