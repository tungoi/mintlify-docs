## The Core Principle: One Object to Rule Them All

In traditional software, a "Lead" in your CRM is a fundamentally different entity from a "Task" in your project management tool. They live in separate databases, have different hardcoded properties, and cannot interact without complex integrations. This is the primary source of data silos in business.

Luklak is built on a revolutionary principle: at the deepest architectural level, a Lead, a Task, a Contract, and a Support Ticket are **all the same thing**. They are all instances of the one `ðŸ§Š Universal Object`.

<Tip>
Think of the Universal Object as "smart clay." It's a formless, powerful material that you, the architect, can mold into any shape your business needsâ€”a "cup" (Task), a "plate" (Lead), or a "vase" (Project). The material is the same; only the form you give it changes.
</Tip>

This is made possible by two key design choices: a flexible schema and universal, built-in capabilities.

## Flexible by Design: The Unstructured Schema

The power of the Universal Object comes from what it *doesn't* have: a rigid, predefined data structure. Unlike a traditional database table, the core Object itself has no fixed schema.

You, the architect, define the schema when you design an **Object Type** in a `ðŸ“‹ Function`. You give the "smart clay" its shape by attaching a custom set of `Data Fields`.

- Your **"Candidate"** Object Type gets a `Resume` file field and an `Interview Stage` selection field.
- Your **"Sales Deal"** Object Type gets a `Deal Value` currency field and a `Closing Date` field.
- Your **"Software Bug"** Object Type gets a `Priority` field and an `Assignee` user field.

The underlying "matter" is identical, which means they can all be understood by the same platform services. The structure you apply is completely custom and flexible.

## Universal by Default: Built-in Superpowers

Because every single thing you create is fundamentally a Universal Object, every Objectâ€”regardless of its Typeâ€”automatically inherits a powerful set of platform-wide capabilities. This is what truly eliminates silos and makes Luklak a unified system.

<Info>
This is the "secret sauce" of Luklak. It's why you don't need clunky integrations to make your CRM "talk" to your project manager. In Luklak, they are already speaking the same language because they are made of the same universal matter.

Now that you understand the theory behind the Universal Object, let's clarify the practical distinction between the blueprint (`Object Type`) and the live instance (`Object`).
