## Before You Begin

This tutorial will walk you through the practical steps of creating a simple but functional "Task" Object Type from scratch. This process is the heart of designing any solution in Luklak.

<Info>
  **Prerequisite:** `Object Types` can only be designed inside a `üìã Function`. Before starting, please ensure you have created a new, empty Function to work in. For this guide, let's assume you've created one named "Project Management".
</Info>

Remember, the `Object Type` is the **blueprint** for a business process. We are now in the workshop, designing that blueprint.

## The Design Process: An Overview

We will follow three main steps to create our "Task" Object Type:

1. **Create the Object Type**: Give it a name and an icon.
2. **Design the Workflow**: Define the lifecycle statuses for a task.
3. **Add Data Fields**: Specify what information a task needs to store.

## Step-by-Step Guide: Creating a 'Task' Object Type

```guidejar
# Creating a 'Task' Object Type
This guide walks you through designing a simple but functional 'Task' Object Type inside a Function.

## Section 1: Create the Object Type
! Important: Make sure you are inside the design canvas of your 'Project Management' Function.

1.  From the left sidebar of the Function designer, navigate to the **'Object Types'** tab.
    ![Screenshot showing the Function design canvas with the 'Object Types' tab highlighted.](/images/object-types/tutorial-step1.png)
2.  Click the **'+ New Object Type'** button at the top of the list.
    * A configuration panel will open.
3.  Enter the following details in the panel:
    - **Name:** `Task`
    - **Icon:** Select a 'check-square' icon from the library.

4.  Click **'Create'**.
    * Your new 'Task' Object Type is now created and appears in the list, ready for configuration.

## Section 2: Design the Workflow
* Tip: The workflow visualizes the lifecycle of your task. Let's create a simple 'To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Done' flow.

1.  With the 'Task' Object Type selected, click on the **'Workflow'** sub-tab to open the workflow canvas.
    ![Screenshot of the workflow canvas, which is initially empty or has a single default status.](/images/object-types/tutorial-step3.png)
2.  Click **'+ Add Status'** three times to create your statuses. Name them:
    - `To Do` (Set Type to: To Do)
    - `In Progress` (Set Type to: In Progress)
    - `Done` (Set Type to: Done)
3.  Create transitions between the statuses by clicking the '+' icon on the edge of a status and dragging the arrow to the next one.
    - Connect `To Do` ‚Üí `In Progress`.
    - Connect `In Progress` ‚Üí `Done`.

## Section 3: Add Data Fields
* Tip: Data fields are how you store essential information on each task. Let's add fields for an assignee, a due date, and a priority level.

1.  Click on the **'Data Fields'** sub-tab for your 'Task' Object Type.
    ![Screenshot of the Data Fields list, which may already show some system-generated fields.](/images/object-types/tutorial-step5.png)
2.  Click **'+ Add Field'** and create the following three custom fields:
    - **Field 1:** Name: `Assignee`, Type: `User`.
    - **Field 2:** Name: `Due Date`, Type: `Date`.
    - **Field 3:** Name: `Priority`, Type: `Select List`. In the options for this field, add: `High`, `Medium`, and `Low`.
    ![Screenshot showing the list of the three newly added custom fields: Assignee, Due Date, and Priority.](/images/object-types/tutorial-step6.png)
```

## You've Built Your First Blueprint\!

Congratulations\! You have successfully designed a complete, albeit simple, Object Type. This "Task" blueprint now has:

- A clear identity (name and icon).
- A 3-step lifecycle (`Workflow`).
- The ability to store crucial information (`Data Fields`).

This Object Type is now ready to be used in a `‚èπÔ∏è Space` to create real tasks.

## What's Next?

You've created a basic blueprint. Now you can learn about more advanced configurations to make your Object Types even more powerful.
