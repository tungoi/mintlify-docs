<Info>
  Welcome to Phase 1. Before you can build your powerful business solutions, you must first establish the foundational rules of your digital world. This is the essential first step for any system administrator, ensuring your Luklak instance is secure, organized, and ready for your teams.
</Info>

This process involves two distinct but related systems of control: defining who's in your world, and then defining what they are allowed to touch. 

## Step 1: Define Your People & Powers

First, you must populate your instance with users and grant them their fundamental level of authority.

### Users, Groups, and Roles

The initial task is to create `User` accounts for every person on your team. To manage them efficiently, you can organize these users into `Groups` (e.g., "Sales Team," "HR Managers") and assign them to `Roles` (e.g., "Approver," "Auditor") that represent their function in a business process. This allows you to assign permissions to a Group or Role once, rather than to hundreds of individual users.

### The Entry Gate: Business Privileges

Before a user can do anything, they need a **Business Privilege**. This acts as their "entry ticket" and defines their maximum, system-wide authority. Think of it as their passport stamp‚Äîit determines if they are allowed in the country and what general status they hold.

There are four main privilege levels:

    The highest level. Manages billing, can transfer ownership, and holds all Admin privileges.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Admin" icon="user-gear" iconType="duotone">
    Can configure everything in the system, from Global Settings to user management.
  </Card>
  <Card title="App Manager" icon="map" iconType="duotone">
    A specialized role that can design, edit, and manage `üìã Functions` and other applications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Member" icon="user" iconType="duotone">
    The standard privilege for most users, allowing them to work within the `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces` they are given access to.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step 2: Define Who Can Touch What

Once a user is "inside the gates" with their Business Privilege, a second, more granular layer of permission takes over.

### The In-World Rules: Item Access Control

**Item Access Control** determines who can **view, use, edit, or manage every single component (or "Item")** you build inside Luklak. If Business Privilege is the passport, Item Access is the key to specific buildings, rooms, and file cabinets.

Crucially, this access is configured **directly on each individual Item**.

<Tip>
  For example, to control who can edit your "CRM" `Function`, you configure Item Access **on that specific Function**. To control who sees the "Q4 Financials" `Dashboard`, you set the access **on that Dashboard**. This gives you precise, contextual control over every part of your system.
