<Info>
  Before you can build your powerful business solutions, you must first establish the foundational rules of your digital world. The Ground Layer is where system administrators ensure the Luklak instance is secure, organized, and ready for your teams.
</Info>

This process involves two distinct but related systems of control: defining who's in your world, and then defining what they are allowed to touch.

## Step 1: Define Your People & Powers

First, you must populate your instance with `Users`, organize them into `Groups`, and define the `Roles` they will play. Once the people are defined, you grant them their fundamental level of authority.

### The Entry Gate: Business Privileges

Before a user can do anything, they need a **Business Privilege**. This acts as their "entry ticket" and defines their maximum, system-wide authority. Think of it as their passport stamp‚Äîit determines if they are allowed in the country and what general status they hold.

    The highest level. Manages billing, can transfer ownership, and holds all Admin privileges.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Admin" icon="user-gear" iconType="duotone">
    Can configure everything in the system, from Global Settings to user management.
  </Card>
  <Card title="App Manager" icon="map" iconType="duotone">
    A specialized role that can design, edit, and manage `üìã Functions`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Member" icon="user" iconType="duotone">
    The standard privilege for most users, allowing them to work within the `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces` they are given access to.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step 2: Define Who Can Touch What

Once a user is "inside the gates" with their Business Privilege, a second, more granular layer of permission takes over.

### The In-World Rules: Item Access Control

**Item Access Control** determines who can view, use, edit, or manage every single component (or "Item") you build inside Luklak. If Business Privilege is the passport, Item Access is the key to specific buildings, rooms, and file cabinets. Crucially, this access is configured **directly on each individual Item**.

<Tip>
  For example, to control who can edit your "CRM" `Function`, you configure Item Access **on that specific Function**. To control who sees the "Q4 Financials" `Dashboard`, you set the access **on that Dashboard**. This gives you precise, contextual control over every part of your system.
