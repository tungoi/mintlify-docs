**Why This Matters**

<Warning>
  Traditional business software creates invisible walls between departments. Sales data is trapped in a CRM, project updates are lost in a separate tool, and customer feedback sits isolated in another. This friction slows you down, creates data silos, and prevents your teams from working as a unified force.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Luklak is fundamentally different. It's not a collection of apps—it's a single, universal foundation for building your company's entire business operating system. By providing a common set of powerful building blocks, Luklak eliminates the friction between processes, unlocking true organizational agility and a seamless flow of value from one end of your business to the other.

**The Big Picture**

To achieve this unique level of unification, the Luklak platform is built on a simple yet powerful 3-Tier Architecture. Understanding this model is the key to unlocking the platform's full potential.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tier 1: Core Blocks" icon="cube" iconType="duotone">
    This is the foundational layer—the universal "LEGO pieces" that all business processes are built from. This includes our 9 universal components:

    - **`🧊 Universal Object`**: The core logical unit for any business entity.
    - **`Workflow`**: Defines the statuses and transitions to model a business process.
    - **`Data Field`**: Custom fields to capture all necessary information for an Object.
    - **`Workview`**: Customizable visual layouts (List, Kanban, Calendar) for managing Objects.
    - **`Universal Query Language (UQL)`**: A natural language-like system for querying all data across the platform.
    - **`Universal Automation`**: The platform-wide engine that connects and automates any process.
    - **`Object Connection`**: The system for creating powerful relationships between any Objects.
    - **`Unified Live Chat`**: An integrated, three-tiered communication system for perfect context.
    - **`Permission & Notification`**: Fine-grained access control and alert schemes to ensure security and awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tier 2: Function Design" icon="map" iconType="duotone">
    This is the blueprint layer. Here, you assemble the Core Blocks into no-code designs called `📋 Functions`. A `📋 Function` is a complete operational blueprint for a specific business process, like a sales CRM or a project management system. It defines the specific `🧊 Object` types, workflows, data fields, and automations required for that process.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tier 3: Usage & Operation" icon="table-columns" iconType="duotone">
    This is the live application layer where work actually happens. When you deploy a `📋 Function`, it becomes one or more live `⏹️ Spaces`. This layer includes three key ways to organize and interact with work:

    - **Organizational Structure**: The hierarchy of `📂 Areas` and `⏹️ Spaces` creates the official, unified structure for the entire company. An `📂 Area` (e.g., "Sales Department") contains multiple related `⏹️ Spaces` (e.g., "CRM" and "Contract Management").
    - **Workspaces**: A flexible tool primarily for managers. A Workspace allows a user to pull various `⏹️ Spaces`, reports, and filters from different `📂 Areas` into a single, personalized view for convenient monitoring and management.
    - **Personal Home**: An automatically aggregated view for every individual user. It collects all assigned `🧊 Objects` and relevant updates from across the entire platform, ensuring each person has a single place to see what they need to work on.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

This architecture allows for both incredible flexibility in design (Tier 2) and complete consistency in operation (Tier 3), all built upon a single, unified foundation (Tier 1).
