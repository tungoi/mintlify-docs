## The Big Picture: Your Digital Land

Subscribing to Luklak isn't like buying a pre-built house; it's like being given a plot of digital land, complete with a full supply of advanced building materials and utilities. We provide the laws of physics and the raw components, but you are the architect.

Our platform architecture follows this "outside-in" logic. First, you establish the foundation (the rules of your land). Then, you begin construction.

## Phase 1: Establish the Foundation

Before you build, you must define the fundamental rules of governance. This is a two-step process that controls who can enter your world and what they are allowed to do once inside.

### The Entry Gate: Business Privileges

First, every user needs an "entry ticket" to access your company's Luklak instance. This is their **Business Privilege**, a system-wide setting that defines their fundamental authority level. There are four main privilege levels:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Owner" icon="crown" iconType="duotone">
    The highest level. Manages billing, can transfer ownership, and holds all Admin privileges.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Admin" icon="user-gear" iconType="duotone">
    Can configure everything in the system, from Global Settings to user management.
  </Card>
  <Card title="App Manager" icon="map" iconType="duotone">
    A specialized role that can design, edit, and manage `üìã Functions` and other applications.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Member" icon="user" iconType="duotone">
    The standard privilege for most users, allowing them to work within the `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces` they are given access to.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### The In-World Rules: Item Access Control

Once a user is "inside the gates" with their Business Privilege, a second, more granular layer of permission takes over: **Item Access Control**.

This system determines who can **view, use, edit, or manage every single component (or "Item")** you build inside Luklak. This access is configured _directly on each individual Item_.

<Tip>
  For example, to control who can edit your "CRM" `Function`, you configure Item Access **on that specific Function**. To control who sees the "Q4 Financials" `Dashboard`, you set the access **on that Dashboard**. This gives you precise control over every part of your system.
</Tip>

## Phase 2: The 3 Tiers of Construction

With the foundational rules of governance established, you can begin building your actual business processes using Luklak's powerful 3-Tier Architecture.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tier 1: Core Blocks (The Raw Materials)" icon="cube" iconType="duotone">
    This is the layer of universal "LEGO pieces" that all processes are made from. It includes our 9 universal components like the `üßä Universal Object`, `Workflow`, and `Universal Automation`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tier 2: Function Design (The Blueprints)" icon="map" iconType="duotone">
    In this layer, you assemble the Core Blocks into no-code designs called `üìã Functions`. A `üìã Function` is a complete, reusable operational blueprint for a process like a CRM or a recruitment pipeline.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tier 3: Usage & Operation (The Live Buildings)" icon="building" iconType="duotone">
    This is where work happens. When you deploy a `üìã Function`, it becomes one or more live `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces`‚Äîthe active "buildings" where your teams collaborate and execute daily work.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What's Next?

Understanding this 2-phase architecture is the key to mastering Luklak. Your next step depends on your role:

- **For Administrators:** Your first priority is setting up the foundation.

- **For Architects & Builders:** With the foundation understood, it's time to see your materials.
