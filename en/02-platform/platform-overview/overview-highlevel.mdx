## The Luklak Analogy: Your Digital Land

Subscribing to Luklak isn't like buying a pre-built house; it's like acquiring a plot of digital land. We provide the laws of physics and the raw materials, but you are the architect. This unique approach allows you to design and build the exact operational "house"‚Äîor rather, the entire digital city‚Äîthat your business needs to thrive.

Before you can build, you must first establish the foundational rules of your world.

## The Foundation: Global Settings

Global Settings are the bedrock of your entire Luklak instance. This is where system administrators define the fundamental governance and access control that underpins everything else. Key configurations include:

- **Users & Groups:** Creating the accounts for every person who will work in the system and organizing them into functional teams (`Groups`) like "Sales Team" or "HR Managers".
- **Business Privileges:** Assigning high-level system powers (e.g., `Owner`, `Admin`) that grant broad administrative capabilities.
- **Item Access Control:** This is the granular permission system that controls who can **view, use, edit, or manage every single component (or "Item")** within Luklak. It ensures that only authorized architects can design `üìã Functions`, only relevant managers can create new `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces`, and sensitive reports are only visible to the right people.

<Info>
  The principle of Item Access applies to every component in Luklak. As you explore each concept in our documentation, you'll find specific guides on how to manage its access rights.

  See: [Function Access Control](/platform/function-design/index.mdx#function-access-control), [Managing Space Permissions](/user-guides/organizing-work#space-settings), [Sharing Filters & Dashboards](/user-guides/reports-and-dashboards#sharing-dashboards).

## The 3 Tiers of Building: Constructing Your Operations

Once your foundational rules are set, you can begin construction using Luklak's powerful 3-Tier Architecture. This is the framework you use to build your actual business processes on your digital land.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tier 1: Core Blocks (The Raw Materials)">
    This is the foundational layer of building materials‚Äîthe universal "LEGO pieces" that all business processes are made from. This includes our 9 universal components like the `üßä Universal Object`, `Workflow`, `Universal Automation`, and `Data Fields`.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tier 2: Function Design (The Blueprints)">
    This is the design layer. Here, you assemble the Core Blocks into no-code designs called `üìã Functions`. A `üìã Function` is a complete, reusable operational blueprint for a specific business process, like a sales CRM or a recruitment pipeline.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tier 3: Usage & Operation (The Live Buildings)">
    This is the live application layer where work actually happens. When you deploy a `üìã Function`, it becomes one or more live `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces`‚Äîthe active "buildings" in your digital city where your teams collaborate and execute their daily work.
