## Two Levels of Security

<Info>
  To build secure, well-governed systems in Luklak, it's crucial to understand the two distinct and complementary layers of security: **Item Access Control** and **Permission Schemes**.
</Info>

While they both manage "who can do what," they operate at different levels.

- **Item Access** controls access to the **container** (the workspace, the dashboard, the blueprint).
- A **Permission Scheme** controls actions **inside** the container.

## The Analogy: The Building and the Safe

The easiest way to understand the difference is with an analogy of a secure building.

### Item Access Control is the Key to the Building

This is the first layer of security. It determines if you are allowed to enter a specific "building" (like a `‚èπÔ∏è Space` or a `Dashboard`). If you don't have Item Access, you can't even see that the building exists or open its door.

**It answers the question: "Can I get in the door?"**

### Permission Scheme is the Clearance for the Safe

Once you are inside the building, the Permission Scheme determines what you are allowed to _do_ inside. It's your security clearance level for the contents of the building (the `üßä Objects`).

<Note>
  Are you allowed to view the documents on the table (`View Objects`)? Can you create new documents (`Create Objects`)? Or do you have the high-level clearance needed to open the safe (`Delete Objects`) or approve a document (`Transition Status`)?
</Note>

**It answers the question: "What can I do now that I'm inside?"**

## Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature                     | `Item Access Control`                                      | `Permission Scheme`                                                         |
| :-------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **What it Controls**        | **Containers** (the tools)                                 | **`Actions on üßä Objects`** (the data inside the tools)                     |
| **Examples of "Items"**     | `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces`, `üìã Functions`, `Dashboards`, `Saved Filters` | `View`, `Create`, `Edit`, `Delete`, `Transition Status` for `üßä Objects`    |
| **Where it's Configured**   | **On the Item itself** (e.g., in the `Space` settings)     | **`Inside a üìã Function`** (as a reusable blueprint)                        |
| **Who it's Assigned To**    | Directly to `Users` or `Groups`.                           | To `Roles` (e.g., `Manager`, `Member`). Users are then assigned to `Roles`. |
| **The Question it Answers** | "Can I **access** this `Space`?"                           | "What can I **do** inside this `Space`?"                                    |

## How They Work Together: A Practical Example

1. **Granting Item Access:** An administrator gives the "Sales Team" `Group` **Member access** to the "Q4 Sales Pipeline" `‚èπÔ∏è Space`. Now, all users in that group, including Jane and John, can see and enter this `Space`.
2. **Assigning Roles:** The `Permission Scheme` for this `Space` (designed in its `Function`) has two `Roles`: `Manager` and `Member`.
   - Jane, a senior salesperson, is assigned the **`Manager Role`**.
   - John, a junior salesperson, is assigned the **`Member Role`**.
3. **The Result:** Even though both Jane and John can enter the `Space` (thanks to Item Access), their abilities inside are different. The `Permission Scheme` might allow Jane (`Manager` Role) to `Delete` objects within the function, like`üßä Deals`, while John (`Member` Role) can only `Create` and `Edit` them.

Understanding these two permission layers is fundamental to designing secure and scalable solutions in Luklak.
