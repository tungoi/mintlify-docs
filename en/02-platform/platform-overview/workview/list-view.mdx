## What is the List View?

The **List View** is your primary tool for managing `ðŸ§Š Objects` in a familiar, powerful spreadsheet-style interface. It displays your data in rows (where each row is an `ðŸ§Š Object`) and columns (where each column is a `Data Field`).

This view is the workhorse for data-intensive tasks like reviewing large numbers of `ðŸ§Š Objects`, making quick inline edits, and performing actions on multiple items at once.

## Key Features & How to Use Them

You can customize the List View in several powerful ways to organize the information exactly as you need it.

### Customizing Your Columns
You have complete control over what information is displayed. You can add, remove, reorder, and resize columns to create the perfect view for any task.

1.  Click the **"Columns"** button in the view's toolbar.
2.  In the dropdown menu, **check** the boxes for the `Data Fields` you want to see.
3.  **Uncheck** the boxes for fields you want to hide.
4.  **Drag and drop** the field names within the menu to reorder the columns in your table.

<Tip>
Create multiple List Views for different purposes. A "Financial View" for a project might show `Budget` and `Cost` columns, while a "Resource View" of the same `ðŸ§Š Objects` might show `Assignee` and `Due Date` columns instead.
</Tip>

### Sorting Your Data
Quickly organize your `ðŸ§Š Objects` by sorting them based on the values in any column.

- **Single-Column Sort:** Simply **click on any column header** to sort in ascending order. Click the header again to sort in descending order.
- **Multi-Column Sort:** To add a secondary sorting layer, **hold the `Shift` key and click on a second column header**. For example, you can sort by `Priority` (descending) first, then by `Due Date` (ascending).

### Grouping Your Data
Grouping transforms a long, flat list into an organized, collapsible report. This feature allows you to visually section your rows based on a common field value.

1.  Click the **"Group by"** button in the view's toolbar.
2.  Select the field you want to group by (e.g., `Assignee`, `Status`, `Priority`).

The list will instantly be organized into sections with a header for each group (e.g., a header for "Jane Doe" showing all her assigned tasks). You can expand and collapse these groups as needed.

### Performing Bulk Operations
Save time by selecting multiple `ðŸ§Š Objects` and applying an action to all of them simultaneously.

1.  Use the **checkboxes** next to each row to select the `ðŸ§Š Objects` you want to modify.
2.  A bulk action toolbar will appear at the top or bottom of the screen.
3.  From this toolbar, you can choose to **Edit** a field, **Change Status**, **Delete**, or perform other available actions on all selected items in a single click.
