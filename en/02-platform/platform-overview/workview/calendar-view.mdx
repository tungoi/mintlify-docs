## What is the Calendar View?

The **Calendar View** provides a familiar and intuitive way to visualize your `ðŸ§Š Objects` on a standard monthly, weekly, or daily calendar layout. It is the perfect tool for managing deadlines, scheduling events, and planning work that is tied to specific dates.

If the `Timeline View` is for long-term project scheduling, the `Calendar View` is for day-to-day time management.

## Configuration: Mapping Your Dates

To display your `ðŸ§Š Objects` on the calendar, you must tell Luklak which `Date` fields to use.

1. In the Calendar view's settings, find the **"Date Mapping"** option.
2. **`To display ðŸ§Š Objects with a single important date (like a deadline):`**
   - Map the **"Date"** or **"Start Date"** setting to your primary `Date` field (e.g., `Due Date`). The `ðŸ§Š Object` will appear as a single-day event on the calendar.
3. **`To display ðŸ§Š Objects that span a date range (like an event or a vacation):`**
   - Map the **"Start Date"** setting to your start date field (e.g., `Event Start`).
   - Map the **"End Date"** setting to your end date field (e.g., `Event End`). The `ðŸ§Š Object` will appear as a bar stretching across multiple days on the calendar.

<Tip>
  You can create multiple calendar views for the same set of `ðŸ§Š Objects`. One calendar could show their `Due Dates`, while a second calendar could show their `Publication Dates`, giving you different temporal perspectives on your work.

## Working with Your Calendar

The Calendar View is designed for easy planning and interaction.

### Changing Views

Easily switch between **Monthly**, **Weekly**, and **Daily** layouts using the controls at the top of the calendar to get the right level of detail for your planning needs.

### Drag and Drop to Reschedule

Need to change a deadline? Simply **click and drag** an `ðŸ§Š Object` from one day on the calendar and drop it onto another. This action will instantly and automatically **`update the Date field`** on that `ðŸ§Š Object` to the new date. It's the most intuitive way to manage your schedule.

### Creating New Objects

You can quickly create a new `ðŸ§Š Object` for a specific day by **`clicking the + icon`** that appears when you hover over a date on the calendar. This will open the new `Object` creation form with the date field already pre-populated.
