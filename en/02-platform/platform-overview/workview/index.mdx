## Why Workviews Matter

Your data is only useful if your team can see it and interact with it effectively. A sales team needs a different view of `üßä Customer` data than a project management team does. Forcing everyone into a single, rigid "one-size-fits-all" table creates friction and lowers productivity.

**Workviews** are Luklak's solution. A Workview is a configurable **"lens"** through which you and your team can view and interact with a set of `üßä Objects`. You can create multiple views of the same underlying data, allowing every team to work in the way that best suits their process.

## The Standard View Types

Luklak provides a set of standard, powerful view types that you can customize to fit your needs.

## Template vs. Instance: Where to Create Workviews

As an architect, you have two options for creating Workviews, depending on your goal:

1.  **In a `üìã Function` (As a Template):** When you create a Workview inside a `Function`, you are creating a **master template**. This pre-configured view will then be automatically available in every single `‚èπÔ∏è Space` created from that `Function`. This is the best practice for standardizing how core processes should be viewed.

2.  **In a `‚èπÔ∏è Space` (As a Custom Instance):** Users can also create their own private or shared Workviews directly within a `Space`. These are useful for specific, temporary needs or for personal views that aren't relevant to the entire process.

**Architect's Tip:** Define your most important, process-critical views within the `Function`. This ensures every team starts with a consistent, best-practice interface, which they can then supplement with their own custom views in the `Space` if needed.
