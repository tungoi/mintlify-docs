## What is the Updates View?

The **Updates View** provides a single, real-time activity stream of everything that's happening to the `ðŸ§Š Objects` you are looking at. Instead of a table or a board, it presents information as a chronological feed, similar to a social media timeline, with the newest updates at the top.

It's designed to help you and your team stay on top of all recent changes, conversations, and progress without having to click into every individual `ðŸ§Š Object`.

## What's Included in the Feed?

The activity feed consolidates several key event types into one easy-to-read stream:

- **Field Changes:** See a record of any updates made to `Data Fields`, such as a change in `Assignee`, `Due Date`, or `Priority`.
- **Status Transitions:** Track the progress of work as `ðŸ§Š Objects` move from one `Status` to the next (e.g., `TO DO` â†’ `IN PROGRESS`).
- **New Messages:** Read all new messages from the `Object Chat` for all `ðŸ§Š Objects` in the view.
- **File Attachments:** Get notified when new files are attached to an `ðŸ§Š Object`.
- **New Sub-Objects or Checklist Items:** See when new `ðŸ§Š Sub-Objects` are created or checklist items are added and completed.

## How to Use the Updates View

The Updates View is a powerful tool for both broad oversight and focused catch-ups.

### Getting the Big Picture

By default, the view shows a combined feed of all `ðŸ§Š Objects` included in your current filter. This is perfect for a manager who wants to get a quick overview of all team activity in the last few hours.

### Focusing on a Single Object

The view typically includes a side panel listing all the `ðŸ§Š Objects` that are part of the current filter. You can click on any `ðŸ§Š Object` in this list to filter the feed instantly and see **only the activity history for that specific item**. This allows you to quickly get the full context and history of a single piece of work.

### Interacting Directly from the Feed

The Updates View is not just for reading. You can reply to messages, @mention colleagues, and add your own comments directly from the feed, making it a powerful tool for asynchronous collaboration.

<Tip>
  Combine the Updates View with a `Saved Filter` to create powerful, custom feeds. For example, create a "My High Priority Tasks" filter and then switch to the Updates View to see a real-time feed of only the work that matters most to you right now.
