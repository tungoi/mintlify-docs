## The Foundation of Your Headquarters

<Note>
  As introduced in our [Platform Architecture overview](/platform), the **Ground Layer** provides the secure, governed foundation upon which your entire digital headquarters is built. It is the land and the law.
</Note>

<Info>
  This layer consists of a sophisticated, **3-tier governance model** that gives you precise control over who can see and do what. To understand it, think of your Luklak instance as a secure corporate campus where a user must pass through three distinct security checks to perform any action.

## Tier 1: Business Privilege - Your Campus ID Badge

This is the highest level of access. A user's **Business Privilege** determines if they are allowed onto the campus at all and defines their maximum potential authority. It's the first gate everyone must pass.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Owner" icon="crown" iconType="duotone">
    The highest level. Manages billing and holds all Admin privileges. Can add or remove everyone, including Admins.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Admin" icon="user-gear" iconType="duotone">
    Can configure everything in the system, from users to global settings, but cannot remove the Owner.

  <Card title="Member" icon="user" iconType="duotone">
    The standard privilege for most users to work within `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces`.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Tier 2: Item Access - The Keys to the Buildings

Once a user is on campus, **Item Access Control** determines which specific "buildings" they can enter. These "Items" are high-level containers like a `üìã Function`, a `Dashboard`, or a `‚èπÔ∏è Space`. This tier answers the question: "Which workspaces and tools can you access?"

  ## Putting It All Together: A Governance Matrix Example

  <Info>
    A user must have the correct permissions at **all three tiers** to perform an action. Let's use a real-world scenario to illustrate this.

    **Scenario:** A highly confidential "Project Phoenix" M&A `‚èπÔ∏è Space`.
  </Info>
  ### The Setup: A Tier-by-Tier Configuration

  We will configure the permissions for four users: Alice (CEO), Bob (Project Manager), Carol (Legal Team), and David (Sales Team).

  **Tier 1 Setup: Business Privileges**\
  First, we confirm each user's system-wide "Campus ID Badge."

  | User      | Business Privilege | Description                   |
  | :-------- | :----------------- | :---------------------------- |
  | **Alice** | `Admin`            | Has high-level system power.  |
  | **Bob**   | `Member`           | Standard user for daily work. |
  | **Carol** | `Member`           | Standard user for daily work. |
  | **David** | `Member`           | Standard user for daily work. |

  **Tier 2 Setup: Item Access on the 'Project Phoenix' ‚èπÔ∏è Space**
  Next, we grant the "Keys to the Building" for this specific `Space`.

  | User or Group              | Assigned Item Access Level | Reason                                                                                         |
  | :------------------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **Executive Team (Alice)** | `Admin`                    | The executive team needs full control over the `Space`'s settings and access list.             |
  | **Bob**                    | `Manager`                  | As the project manager, Bob needs to manage the `Space`'s content but not its access controls. |
  | **M&A Legal (Carol)**      | `Member`                   | The legal team needs to view and use the `Space` but not change its settings.                  |

  <Warning>
    Note: David and the Sales Team are not on this list, so they have no key to this Space.
  </Warning>
  **Tier 3 Setup: Role Assignment within the 'Project Phoenix' ‚èπÔ∏è Space**
  Finally, we assign the users who can get inside a specific "Role" which was designed in the `Permission Scheme` of the source `Function`.

  | User      | Assigned Role   | (Role is defined in the `Permission Scheme` for this `Space`)             |
  | :-------- | :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | **Bob**   | `Project Lead`  | This Role has permissions to `Create`, `Edit`, and `Delete` `üßä Objects`. |
  | **Carol** | `Legal Counsel` | This Role has permissions to `View` `üßä Objects` and `Add Comments` only. |

  <Warning>
    Note: Alice was not assigned a specific Role for working with the data inside.
  </Warning>
  ### The Outcome

  <Note>
    This table shows the **effective permissions** for each user, demonstrating how the tiers combine to prevent security loopholes.
  </Note>
  | User      | Tier 1 (Privilege) | Tier 2 (Can Enter Space?)               | Tier 3 (Role Inside) | Final Result: Can they...                                                                                                                                                                                              |
  | :-------- | :----------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
  | **Alice** | `Admin`            | ‚úÖ **Yes** (as part of `Executive Team`) | _(No Role assigned)_ | **Can:** Manage the `Space` settings, add/remove members (as `Admin` of the Item).<br />**Cannot:** See `üßä Objects` inside, unless a `Permission Scheme` rule grants access to Admins.                                |
  | **Bob**   | `Member`           | ‚úÖ **Yes** (as `Manager` of the Item)    | `Project Lead`       | **Can:** Enter the `Space`, manage `Space` content, and perform all actions granted to the `Project Lead` Role (e.g., `Create`, `Edit`, `Delete` `üßä Objects`).<br />**Cannot:** Change the `Space`'s access controls. |
  | **Carol** | `Member`           | ‚úÖ **Yes** (as part of `M&A Legal`)      | `Legal Counsel`      | **Can:** Enter the `Space` and perform actions granted to the `Legal Counsel` Role (e.g., `View` `üßä Objects`, `Add Comments`).<br />**Cannot:** `Delete` `üßä Objects` if the Role doesn't permit it.                  |
  | **David** | `Member`           | ‚ùå **No**                                | _(Not Applicable)_   | **Cannot do anything.** Even though David is a `Member` of the business, he was never granted `Item Access` to this specific `Space`. The security model stops him at Tier 2.                                          |
