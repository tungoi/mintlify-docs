## The Brain of Your Automation

If the **Trigger** is the event that starts the race, the **Condition** is the gatekeeper that decides which runners are allowed to compete. It is the "If" in the `Trigger-Condition-Action` model and acts as the brain of your automation rule.

The Condition block uses `Universal Query Language (UQL)` to evaluate the `ðŸ§Š Object` that fired the trigger. This allows you to create highly specific rules that only run when your exact criteria are met, preventing your automations from running unintentionally.

### How Conditions Work

1. A **Trigger** event occurs (e.g., a `ðŸ§Š Task` is updated).
2. The automation engine takes that `ðŸ§Š Task` Object.
3. It then runs your UQL query from the Condition block **`against that specific ðŸ§Š Task`**.
4. If the `ðŸ§Š Task` meets the criteria (the query returns "true"), the Actions proceed.
5. If not, the rule stops silently.

  Think of your UQL query as a simple question that must be answered 'Yes' for the rule to continue.

## Writing Conditions with UQL: Examples

Here are some common patterns for building conditions, from simple to complex.

### Checking a Single Field

This is the most basic and common type of condition.

- **Scenario:** You want an automation to run only for urgent support tickets.
- **Trigger:** `Support Ticket` updated.
- **UQL Condition:** `priority = "URGENT"`
- **Explanation:** The rule will only proceed if the `Priority` select list field on the updated ticket is set to "URGENT".

### Combining Multiple Criteria (`AND` / `OR`)

Create more sophisticated logic by checking multiple fields at once.

- **Scenario:** You want to notify a manager about high-value, stagnant deals.
- **Trigger:** `Deal` updated.
- **UQL Condition:** `deal_value > 50000 AND status = "STALLED"`
- **Explanation:** The `AND` operator ensures the rule only runs if **both** conditions are true. Use `OR` to run the rule if **either** condition is true.

### Working with Dates

Use dynamic date values to create time-based conditions.

- **Scenario:** You want to automatically escalate overdue tasks.
- **Trigger:** Scheduled to run daily.
- **UQL Condition:** `due_date < "today" AND status.category != "Completed"`
- **Explanation:** This condition finds any task whose due date has passed (`< "today"`) and that is not in any `Status` belonging to the "Completed" `Category`.

### Checking for Empty or Filled Fields

This is perfect for data integrity workflows.

- **Scenario:** Remind a user to add a description to a new bug report.
- **Trigger:** `Bug Report` created.
- **UQL Condition:** `description is empty`
- **Explanation:** The `is empty` and `is not empty` operators are essential for checking if critical information has been filled out.

### Referencing Related Objects (Advanced)

Create powerful, context-aware conditions by querying through `Object Picker` fields.

- **Scenario:** You want to run an automation on a `Project` only if its associated `Client` is an enterprise customer.
- **Trigger:** `Project` updated.
- **UQL Condition:** `client.tier = "Enterprise"`
- **Explanation:** If your `Project` `Object Type` has an `Object Picker` field with the key `client`, you can use dot notation to query fields on the referenced `Client` `Object`.
