## Why Universal Automation Matters

<Warning>
  In traditional software stacks, your CRM, project management tool, and HR system are separate apps. To make them work together, you rely on clunky, third-party integration tools that are brittle, limited, and create yet another system to manage.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  Luklak's **Universal Automation** is fundamentally different. Because every process in Luklak is built on the `ðŸ§Š Universal Object`, our automation engine is not an external add-on; it's a **native, universal layer** woven into the fabric of the platform.

This allows you to build a powerful, reliable "digital workforce" that can automate entire value streamsâ€”from a new lead in your CRM `Function` triggering a project kick-off in your Operations `Function`â€”without ever leaving the platform.

## The Core Principle: Trigger â†’ Condition â†’ Action

Every automation rule in Luklak, from the simplest to the most complex, follows a simple, logical pattern:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="1. Trigger" icon="bolt" iconType="duotone">
    The event that starts the automation. This could be an `ðŸ§Š Object` being created, a field being updated, a specific time of day, or an incoming signal from another app.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Condition" icon="code-branch" iconType="duotone">
    The logical check that determines if the automation should proceed. It acts as a smart filter, ensuring the rule only runs when your specific criteria are met.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Action" icon="rocket-launch" iconType="duotone">
    The work that the automation performs. This can be anything from updating a field and sending a message to creating a new `ðŸ§Š Object` or calling an external system.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Because Luklak's automation is universal, you can do things that are impossible in other systems without complex code. An update to a `ðŸ§Š Customer` Object in your CRM can automatically create a `ðŸ§Š Task` Object in your Project Management `Function`. No external integration tool is required.
