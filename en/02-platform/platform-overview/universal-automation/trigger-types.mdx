## The Starting Point of Automation

The **Trigger** is the "When" of your automation ruleâ€”the specific event that tells the system to start listening and evaluate the rule's conditions.

Luklak provides a variety of trigger types to cover nearly any business scenario, from automatic background processes to user-initiated actions. Understanding the different categories is the first step in building a powerful automation.

## 1. Silent Triggers: The Automated Workforce

Silent Triggers run automatically in the background without any direct user interaction. They are the workhorses of your automation system, constantly listening for events to occur.

  <Card title="Object Events" icon="cube" iconType="duotone">
    <p>The most common type of trigger. The rule runs when an `ðŸ§Š Object` is **created**, **updated**, or its **status changes**.</p>
    <p>**Use Case:** When a `Field` on a `ðŸ§Š Support Ticket` is *updated* to `Priority = URGENT`, trigger an alert. Or, when a new `ðŸ§Š Lead` is *created*, automatically assign it to a sales representative.</p>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Scheduled" icon="clock" iconType="duotone">
    <p>The rule runs based on a schedule you define (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or a custom cron expression).</p>
    <p>**Use Case:** Every Friday at 5 PM, find all `ðŸ§Š Tasks` with a `Status` of `IN_PROGRESS` and send a summary report to the project manager.</p>

  <Card title="Incoming Webhook" icon="cloud-arrow-down" iconType="duotone">
    <p>The rule is triggered when an external application sends a signal (a webhook) to a unique URL provided by Luklak.</p>
    <p>**Use Case:** When a customer submits a form on your website (e.g., Typeform), it sends a webhook to Luklak to automatically create a new `ðŸ§Š Lead` Object.</p>

## 2. Workflow Triggers: Process-Driven Automation

Workflow Triggers are a special type of rule that is directly embedded within an `ðŸ§Š Object`'s `Workflow`. The automation is inextricably linked to a specific process step.

- **Trigger Event:** The rule executes when a user successfully transitions an `ðŸ§Š Object` **into a specific Status**.
- **Use Case:** When a `ðŸ§Š Candidate` Object is moved to the `HIRED` status, trigger a series of actions to create an onboarding checklist and notify the IT department.
- **Note:** While you *can* use a Silent Trigger for "Status Change," a Workflow Trigger is often better for core process actions because the logic is configured directly on the visual workflow canvas, making it easier to manage.

## 3. Object Actions: User-Initiated Automation

Object Actions allow you to empower your users by giving them "buttons" to run automations manually. These actions appear as menu items on an `ðŸ§Š Object`'s toolbar.

- **Trigger Event:** The rule executes when a user clicks the action button on a specific `ðŸ§Š Object`.
- **Key Feature:** You can control the visibility of each action button based on the `Object Type`, its current `Status`, or the user's `Role` or `Group`.
- **Use Case:** Add an **"Escalate to Manager"** button on `ðŸ§Š Support Tickets`. When clicked, an automation re-assigns the ticket and sends a high-priority message. This button can be configured to be visible only for tickets in an `OPEN` status and hidden for `CLOSED` ones.

## What's Next?

You've mastered the "When" of automation. The next step is to add intelligence with the "If"â€”the conditions that filter your triggers.
