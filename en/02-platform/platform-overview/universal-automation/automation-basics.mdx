## The Logic of Automation

Every automation rule in Luklak, no matter how complex, is built on a simple, three-part foundation: the **Trigger**, the **Condition**, and the **Action**. Mastering this T-C-A model is the key to building any automated process.

In simple terms, every rule answers three questions:

1. **When** should this automation run? (The Trigger)
2. **If** the conditions are right... (The Condition)
3. **Then** do the following work. (The Action)

## Deconstructing the T-C-A Model

Let's break down each component.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Trigger: The 'When'">
    <p>
    The **Trigger** is the specific event that starts your automation rule. The automation engine is constantly listening for this event to occur.

    </p>

    <p>
    **Examples:** "When a new `ðŸ§Š Deal` Object is created," "When the `Status` of a `ðŸ§Š Task` is updated to `DONE`," or "Every Monday at 9:00 AM."

    </p>

    <p>
    **Think of it as:** The starting pistol for a race.

    </p>

    <Info>
      For a complete list of all possible starting events, see our [Guide to Trigger Types](/platform/core-concepts/universal-automation/trigger-types).
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Condition: The 'If'">
    <p>
    The **Condition** is a logical filter that runs _after_ the trigger fires. If the conditions you define are met, the action proceeds. If not, the rule stops.

    </p>

    <p>
    **Example:** "...IF the `Deal Value` is greater than \$10,000 AND the `Lead Source` is 'Website'."

    </p>

    <p>
    **Think of it as:** A security checkpoint that verifies the triggering `Object`'s credentials.

    </p>

    <Info>
      Conditions are built using UQL. To learn more, see our [Guide to Building Conditions](/platform/core-concepts/universal-automation/building-conditions).
    </Info>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Action: The 'Then'">
    <p>
    The **Action** is the work that the automation performs once the conditions are successfully met. A rule can have one or many sequential actions.

    </p>

    <p>
    **Example:** "...THEN create a new `Sub-Object` called 'High-Value Deal Review', assign it to the Sales Manager, and send a message to the #sales channel."

    </p>

    <p>
    **Think of it as:** The mission that gets executed.

    </p>

    <Info>
      For a complete list of all possible tasks your automation can perform, see our [Guide to Action Types](/platform/core-concepts/universal-automation/action-types).

## Controlling the Flow: Execution Logic

Beyond a simple linear path, you can build sophisticated logic within your rule's 'Condition' block to handle different scenarios. This is known as the **Execution Flow**.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="If/Else Flow" icon="arrows-split-up-and-left" iconType="duotone">
    The most basic logic. **IF** the condition is true, perform Action A. **ELSE**, perform Action B. Perfect for simple binary decisions.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Path Flow" icon="sitemap" iconType="duotone">
    Create multiple parallel paths based on different conditions. For example: If `Priority` is `HIGH`, notify manager. If `Type` is `BUG`, create Jira ticket.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Branching Flow" icon="diagram-next" iconType="duotone">
    Used when your rule finds **multiple** `ðŸ§Š Objects`. A Branching flow iterates through each found `ðŸ§Š Object` and applies the actions to each one individually.
  </Card>

[Guidejar Placeholder: A tutorial that builds a simple rule from scratch. Trigger: 'When a Deal is created'. Condition: 'If Deal Value \> \$5000'. Action: 'Send a message to the #deals channel'. This will make the T-C-A model concrete.]
