## Beyond the Build: Ensuring Reliability

Building an automation is only half the battle. A truly great architect ensures their automations are reliable, secure, and easy to manage in a live environment. This is the final, critical step in the automation lifecycle: quality assurance.

This guide covers the crucial **Execution Settings** that control _how_ your rule runs, and the **Activity Log** you'll use to test and debug it.

## Critical Execution Settings

Every automation rule has a set of advanced options that control its runtime behavior and impact on the system.

### Acting Account: Who is Performing the Action?

Every action performed by an automation must be attributed to an "account" for permissions and auditing. Choosing the right account type is critical for security and reliability.

  <Card title="User Account" icon="user" iconType="duotone">
    The rule runs using the permissions of the user who created it. If that user leaves the company or their permissions change, the automation may fail.

    <br />

    **Best for:** Simple, personal automations (e.g., "When a task is assigned to me, add a 'Follow-up' tag").

  <Card title="Functional Account (Recommended)" icon="robot" iconType="duotone">
    A dedicated, non-human technical account created solely for running automations. It has its own specific permissions and is not tied to any single employee.

    <br />

    **Best for:** All critical business processes. It ensures the automation runs consistently and securely, regardless of employee changes.

### Triggering Other Rules: Chaining & Loops

This is a simple toggle that controls whether the actions of _this_ rule can act as a trigger for _other_ automation rules.

- **Enable:** To create a "chain reaction" of automations. For example, a rule that updates a deal's status could trigger a second rule that listens for that specific status update to generate a contract.
- **Disable (Default):** To prevent infinite loops. If Rule A updates Field X, and Rule B is triggered by updates to Field X but _also_ updates Field X, you could create a loop. Disabling this setting on at least one rule breaks the chain.

### Notifications for Automated Actions

This toggle controls whether users receive standard notifications for actions performed by this automation rule.

- **Enable:** To keep users fully informed. If an automation assigns a task to someone, enabling this ensures they receive a notification.
- **Disable:** To reduce notification "noise". If you have a rule that runs every hour to archive old `ðŸ§Š Objects`, you can disable notifications to avoid spamming users with routine background updates.

## Testing & Debugging: The Activity Log

The **Activity Log** is your primary tool for testing and debugging. It is a complete run history of every time a rule has been triggered and executed.

In the log for each rule, you can see:

- **Timestamp:** When the rule ran.
- **`Triggering ðŸ§Š Object:`** Which `ðŸ§Š Object` started the rule.
- **Status:** Whether the execution **Succeeded**, **Failed**, or was **Skipped** (because conditions weren't met).
- **Details:** An expanded view showing exactly which conditions were checked, which actions were performed, and any specific error messages if the rule failed.
