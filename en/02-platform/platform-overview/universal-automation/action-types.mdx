## The Power of Action

The **Action** is the "Then" of your automation rule‚Äîit's the work your digital workforce actually performs after a `Trigger` has fired and all `Conditions` have been met.

Luklak provides a rich library of actions, from simple data updates to complex integrations with external systems. This guide serves as a comprehensive reference for everything your automations can do.

## 1. Object & Data Manipulation

These actions directly create or modify your `üßä Objects` and their data. They are the most common building blocks for internal process automation.

- **Create new Object:** Create a new standard `üßä Object` or `üßä Sub-Object` in any `Function`.
- **Update data fields:** Modify the value of one or more fields on the triggering `üßä Object` or a related `Object`.
- **Transition status:** Move an `üßä Object` to a new `Status` in its workflow.
- **Increment/decrement number:** Increase or decrease the value of a number field by a specific amount, perfect for counters or inventory management.
- **Create checklist:** Dynamically generate a list of checklist items inside an `üßä Object`.
- **Create connection between Objects:** Establish a defined `Global Connection` between two `üßä Objects`.

## 2. Communication & Notification

These actions send messages and alerts to both internal users and external contacts, ensuring the right people have the right information at the right time.

### Internal Messaging

- **Send Private Message:** Send a direct message to a specific user's `Unified Inbox`.
- **Post in Space Chat:** Post a message in the group chat of a `‚èπÔ∏è Space` for all members to see.
- **Post in Object Chat:** Send a message directly to a specific `üßä Object`'s chat feed, keeping the conversation in context.

### External Communication

- **Send Email:** Send customized emails to users or external addresses, using `Smart Values` to personalize the subject and body.
- **Send Zalo ZNS:** Send template-based notification messages to phone numbers via Zalo's official ZNS service.
- **Initiate VOIP Call:** Trigger a call to a phone number stored in a field. This is often used as a manual `Object Action` for sales or support teams to quickly connect with customers.

## 3. User & System Interaction

This category covers special actions that interact directly with the user or system processes.

- **Show Input Screen:** A special action tied to `Workflow Triggers`. When a user changes an `üßä Object`'s status, this action can prompt them with a form to fill in required data before the transition is allowed to complete.

## 4. External Integrations

These actions allow Luklak to communicate with the outside world, acting as the central hub for your entire tool stack.

## What's Next?

You've seen the vast library of actions your digital workforce can perform. The key to making these actions truly intelligent is to populate them with dynamic data from your `üßä Objects`.
