## Why This Matters

<Info>
  The most critical business conversations‚Äîa decision on a client proposal, a key piece of feedback on a design, a question about a bug report‚Äîare often the hardest to find weeks later. They get lost in endless email chains, buried in generic Slack channels, or simply evaporate after a meeting. This information fragmentation is a silent killer of productivity.
</Info>

Object Chat solves this by creating a permanent, contextual home for every conversation.

## The Big Picture: A Living Record of Work

  A complete, real-time chat feed built directly into every single üßä Object, keeping conversations perfectly in context with the work itself.
</Card>

**Object Chat** is the third and most powerful level of Luklak's Unified Live Chat architecture. This feature fundamentally changes what an `üßä Object` is. It's no longer just a static collection of data fields; it becomes a living record that combines two crucial types of information:

1. **Structured Data:** The fields, statuses, assignees, and dates that define the work.
2. **Unstructured Conversation:** The real-time discussion, debate, and decision-making about that work.

Visually, Object Chat is seamlessly integrated with the Object's data. When viewing an Object in a side panel, the chat feed appears directly below the structured fields. In a full-screen, expanded view, the chat occupies a dedicated panel on the right, allowing you to see the conversation alongside the data at all times.

<Tip>
  Think of every `üßä Object` as its own dedicated, hyper-focused meeting room. The topic is clear, the right people are there, and the entire history of the conversation is permanently recorded and accessible at any time.
</Tip>

## Step-by-Step Guide: Chatting on an Object

Communicating directly on an `üßä Object` is simple and intuitive. All discussions related to a specific task, deal, or item happen right where the work is managed.

<Warning>
  You must be a member of the `‚èπÔ∏è Space` or have explicit access to the `üßä Object` to view and participate in its chat.

# Tutorial: Having a Contextual Conversation

This tutorial shows you how to use Object Chat to communicate about a specific work item.

## Section 1: Start a Conversation

1.  **Open an Object**
    Navigate to any `‚èπÔ∏è Space` and click on an `üßä Object` from a Workview (like a List or Kanban board) to open its detailed view.
    ![A user clicking on an Object card in a Kanban view.](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x600.png/000000/FFFFFF?text=Step%201:%20Open%20Object)

2.  **Find the Chat Panel**
    Locate the Live Chat interface. You will see the history of all previous messages here.
    * Tip: In an expanded, full-screen view, the panel is on the right. In a side-panel view, the chat is located directly below the Object's data fields.

3.  **Send Your Message**
    Type your message into the input box at the bottom of the panel. You can use `@mentions` to notify a specific user or team. Press `Enter` to send.

4.  **View the Permanent Record**
    Your message now appears instantly in the chat feed. It is permanently stored with this `üßä Object`, creating an auditable history for anyone who works on it in the future.
```

## Benefits Across the Organization

- **Unprecedented Auditability:** Easily trace the entire history of any work item‚Äîfrom initial request to final approval‚Äîwithout ever leaving the `üßä Object`.
- **Zero Context Switching:** Discuss the work _in_ the work. No more toggling between your project tool and your chat app, copying and pasting links.
- **Effortless Onboarding:** When a new member joins a project, they can get up to speed instantly by simply reading the relevant Object Chat history. No time-consuming handover meetings required.
- **Clarity and Focus:** Never again ask "Where should I post this question?" The answer is always: on the `üßä Object` itself.
