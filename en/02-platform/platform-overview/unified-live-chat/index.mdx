## The Problem: Disconnected Work & Conversation

In most companies, work happens in one place (like a project management tool), and conversations about that work happen in another (like Slack or Teams). This constant context-switching wastes time, buries important decisions in noisy channels, and creates a permanent disconnect between your operational data and the discussions about it.

## The Luklak Solution: A Unified Approach

Luklak is built on the principle that **conversation is a part of the work, not a separate activity.** Our Unified Live Chat is not an add-on module; it's a fundamental layer of the platform, woven into every level of your operations.

This approach bridges the gap between your structured data (the fields on your `üßä Objects`) and your unstructured data (your team's conversations), creating a single source of truth with perfect context.

## The Three-Level Architecture of Communication

To achieve this, communication in Luklak is organized into three distinct, cascading levels.

  <Card title="Level 1: Personal Chat" icon="comment-dots" iconType="duotone">
    The foundation for direct communication. This is for 1-on-1 messages and private group chats, similar to traditional messaging apps but fully integrated within your workspace.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Level 2: Space Chat" icon="message-dots" iconType="duotone">
    A dedicated chat channel for each `‚èπÔ∏è Space`. This acts as the central communication hub for a specific team, project, or department, replacing the need for a separate Slack or Teams channel.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Level 3: Object Chat" icon="comment-lines" iconType="duotone">
    The most powerful level. Every single `üßä Object` in the system has its own dedicated, permanent chat feed. This ensures all conversations about a specific task or deal are kept perfectly in context with the work itself.
