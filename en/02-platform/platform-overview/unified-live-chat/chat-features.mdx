## Supercharge Your Conversations

<Info>
Beyond simple messaging, Luklak's Unified Live Chat includes powerful features that work across all three levels of communication‚ÄîPersonal, `‚èπÔ∏è Space`, and `üßä Object`. These tools are designed to ensure no information is lost and that conversation can be turned into structured action seamlessly.
</Info>

This guide covers the three most essential advanced features: notifying colleagues with `@mentions`, bookmarking important information with `Stars`, and turning talk into trackable work by converting a `Message` to an `üßä Object`.

## Never Miss an Update with @mentions

Use `@mentions` to directly notify specific people or entire groups, ensuring your message gets to the right audience immediately. When a user is mentioned, they receive a notification and the message is highlighted in their Personal Home for easy tracking.

```guidejar
# Tutorial: Using @mentions

1.  **Start Typing @**
    In any chat input box, type the `@` symbol.

2.  **Select a User or Role**
    A list will appear showing users and Roles (e.g., `@design-team`, `@approvers`) in the current `‚èπÔ∏è Space`. Select the one you want to notify.

3.  **Send Your Message**
    Finish typing your message and send it. The mentioned user or group will be immediately notified.

## Bookmark Key Information with Stars

A "starred" message acts as a personal bookmark. It's a way to keep track of messages that are important *to you*, without cluttering the main conversation. All your starred messages are conveniently collected in your Personal Home.

```guidejar
# Tutorial: Starring a Message

1.  **Hover Over a Message**
    Move your mouse cursor over the message you want to save.

2.  **Click the Star Icon**
    A set of action icons will appear. Click the `Star` icon.

3.  **Find Your Starred Messages**
    To see all your saved messages, navigate to your `Personal Home` and click on the `Starred` section.
```

## Turn Talk into Action: Convert Message to Object

This is the ultimate bridge between unstructured conversation and structured work. Any message‚Äîan idea, a request, a bug report‚Äîcan be instantly converted into a formal, trackable `üßä Object`. This ensures that valuable insights from conversations are never lost and can be actioned immediately within a proper workflow.

<Tip>
When a user says "Can someone look into this?", you can convert that exact message into a new `üßä Object` and assign it to the right person in seconds.
</Tip>

```guidejar
# Tutorial: Converting a Message to an Object

1.  **Hover and Find More Actions**
    Move your mouse cursor over the message you want to convert. Click the `...` (More actions) icon.

2.  **Select "Convert to Object"**
    From the dropdown menu, choose the `Convert to Object` option.

3.  **Configure the New Object**
    A dialog box will appear. You must:
    * Choose the `‚èπÔ∏è Space` where the new `üßä Object` will be created.
    * Choose the `Object Type` (e.g., Task, Bug, Request) for the new `üßä Object`.
    * The original message content is automatically used as the new Object's description.

4.  **Create the Object**
    Click `Create`. The `üßä Object` is now created and a confirmation message with a direct link to it will appear in the chat for everyone to see.
