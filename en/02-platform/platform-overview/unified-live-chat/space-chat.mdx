## Your Team's Central Communication Hub

**Space Chat** is the second level in Luklak's communication architecture. It is a dedicated, persistent chat channel built into every single `‚èπÔ∏è Space` on the platform.

This feature acts as your team's central hub for all communication related to the specific purpose of that `Space`‚Äîwhether it's for a project, a department, or a business function like "Sales CRM".

  This is your team's shared channel for a specific project or function, replacing the need for an external group chat like Slack or Microsoft Teams.

## The Best of Both Worlds: Chat & Work Together

Many teams use a dedicated Slack channel for each project. This organizes conversations, but it creates a fundamental disconnect: the conversation lives in one app, while the actual work (the `üßä Objects`, data, and workflows) lives in another.

A `‚èπÔ∏è Space` in Luklak solves this by unifying both worlds. It is simultaneously:

1. An **operational workspace** where tasks are managed.
2. The **team's chat room** for discussing that work.

This integrated approach provides several key advantages:

- **Reduced Context Switching:** Your team can discuss project strategy and update the status of `üßä Objects` in the same window, without ever leaving the `Space`.
- **A Single Source of Truth:** All team-level discussions are stored alongside the work itself, creating a complete, unified history for the project.
- **Automatic Membership:** Anyone who is a member of the `‚èπÔ∏è Space` is automatically a member of the `Space Chat`. There's no need to manage two separate lists of people.

## Common Use Cases for Space Chat

`Space Chat` is ideal for team-level communication that isn't about one single task.

- **Project Announcements:** Post a welcome message for new team members or announce a major milestone.
- **General Questions & Blockers:** Ask questions relevant to the whole team, like "Has anyone worked with the new client API before?"
- **Sharing Team-wide Resources:** Post links to shared documents, design mockups, or important external resources.

<Tip>
  **When should you use Object Chat instead?** For conversations about a _specific_ task, deal, or bug, it's always better to use [Level 3: Object Chat](/platform/core-concepts/unified-live-chat/object-chat). This keeps the most specific context directly on the work item itself, making it easy to find later.
