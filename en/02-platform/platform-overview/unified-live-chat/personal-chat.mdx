## The Foundation of Communication

Personal Chat is the first level in Luklak's communication architecture. It provides a private and direct way for you to communicate with your colleagues, either one-on-one or in small, private groups.

Think of it as the familiar experience of a modern messaging app like Messenger or Zalo, but built directly into your work environment, eliminating the need to switch between applications.

## Key Features

Personal Chat is designed for focused, direct communication and supports two primary modes:

- **One-on-One Direct Messages:** Instantly start a private, secure conversation with any other user in your organization. This is perfect for quick questions, sensitive feedback, or any communication that doesn't belong in a public channel.

- **Private Group Chats:** Create small, focused group chats for specific topics or temporary teams. For example, you can create a private group with two other colleagues to quickly coordinate on a presentation without cluttering a larger team `Space Chat`.

## The Integration Advantage

Why use Luklak's Personal Chat instead of an external app? The answer is **deep integration**.

- **The Problem with External Apps:** External messaging apps force you to constantly switch contexts. You discuss a `üßä Task` in an external app, but the `Task` itself lives in Luklak. The conversation history and key decisions become disconnected from the actual work.

- **The Luklak Solution:** Because Personal Chat is a native part of the platform, you can seamlessly reference your work. You can easily copy and paste a link to any `üßä Object`, `‚èπÔ∏è Space`, or `Filter` directly into a chat, and your colleague can click it to go straight to the item within Luklak.

This simple capability keeps conversations flowing without the productivity cost of switching between applications, all while ensuring your communications are securely stored within your company's instance.
