## From Questions to Answers

At its heart, Universal Query Language (UQL) is a way to ask questions about your data. It's designed to be simple and readable, like a natural language sentence, but with the power to find exactly what you're looking for.

This guide will teach you the fundamental "grammar" of UQL, allowing you to write your own precise queries for filters, reports, and automations.

## The Core Structure: `field` `operator` `value`

Almost every basic UQL clause is made of three parts:

1.  **Field:** The `Data Field` you want to check (e.g., `status`, `priority`, `deal_value`).
2.  **Operator:** The comparison you want to make (e.g., `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`).
3.  **Value:** The data you are comparing against (e.g., `"DONE"`, `"HIGH"`, `5000`).

For example: `priority = "HIGH"`

**Syntax Tip:** Text values must always be enclosed in double quotes (`" "`). Numbers do not require quotes. Field and operator names are not case-sensitive, but `Status` names often are.

## A Library of Basic Operators

Here are the most common operators you will use to build your queries.

| Operator        | Meaning                 | Example                                  |
| :-------------- | :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `=`             | Equals                  | `status = "DONE"`                        |
| `!=`            | Does not equal          | `assignee != "John Doe"`                 |
| `>`             | Greater than            | `deal_value > 10000`                     |
| `<`             | Less than               | `risk_score < 5`                         |
| `>=`            | Greater than or equal to| `story_points >= 8`                      |
| `<=`            | Less than or equal to   | `tasks_completed <= 10`                  |
| `in`            | Is one of... (a list)   | `priority in ("HIGH", "URGENT")`         |
| `not in`        | Is not one of... (a list)| `category not in ("Internal", "Archived")`|
| `is empty`      | The field has no value  | `description is empty`                   |
| `is not empty`  | The field has a value   | `assignee is not empty`                  |


## Combining Criteria with `AND` & `OR`

You can create more powerful logic by combining multiple clauses.

- **`AND`**: Use `AND` when you need **all** criteria to be true.
  - **Example:** `status = "OPEN" AND priority = "HIGH"`
  (Finds all `ðŸ§Š Objects` that are both open AND high priority).

- **`OR`**: Use `OR` when you need **at least one** of the criteria to be true.
  - **Example:** `assignee = "currentUser()" OR supervisor = "currentUser()"`
  (Finds all `ðŸ§Š Objects` where the current user is either the assignee OR the supervisor).

- **Parentheses `( )`**: For even more complex logic, you can group criteria with parentheses, just like in mathematics.
  - **Example:** `status = "OPEN" AND (priority = "HIGH" OR due_date < "today")`
  (Finds all open `ðŸ§Š Objects` that are either high priority OR overdue).

You've learned the fundamental grammar of UQL. Now it's time to see how this language is applied across the platform to create powerful, reusable filters.
