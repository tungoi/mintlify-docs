sidebarTitle: "Auto Fields"
---

Beyond the custom fields you create, Luklak automatically provides two types of powerful, built-in fields on every `Object`. Understanding these fields is key to building a rich user experience and leveraging the full analytical power of the platform.

<Info>
  This guide covers fields that are provided by the system.

  - **System Components** are features you can show or hide on a `Data Screen`.
  - **Auto-Generated Fields** are read-only metadata for reporting and automation.
</Info>

## Configurable System Components

These are powerful feature blocks that you can choose to **Show or Hide** on any `Data Screen` to tailor the user experience for a specific `Object Type`.

## Read-Only Auto-Generated Fields

For every single `Object` created, the system automatically generates and maintains a set of read-only metadata fields. While users cannot edit these fields, they are invaluable for sorting, filtering, reporting, and building powerful automations.

| Field Name      | Data Type | Description                                                                |
| :-------------- | :-------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Object key`    | Text      | A unique, system-wide identifier for the Object (e.g., `CRM-1234`).        |
| `creator`       | User      | The user who originally created the Object.                                |
| `created`       | Timestamp | The exact date and time the Object was created.                            |
| `updated`       | Timestamp | The exact date and time any field on the Object was last modified.         |
| `statuschanged` | Timestamp | The exact date and time the Object's status was last changed.              |
| `discussed`     | Timestamp | The exact date and time the last message was sent in the Object's chat.    |
| `interacted`    | Timestamp | The most recent timestamp from `updated`, `statuschanged`, or `discussed`. |

## What's Next?

You now have a complete understanding of every type of data field in Luklakâ€”basic, advanced, and system-provided. The final step is to learn how this rich data is leveraged across the platform.
