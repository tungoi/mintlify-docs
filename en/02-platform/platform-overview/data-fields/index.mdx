## Why Data Modeling Matters

The long-term success of any business system depends on the quality of its data. Poorly structured information leads to inconsistent reporting, failed automations, and a confusing user experience. As an architect, designing a robust data model is one of the most critical parts of your job.

Luklak's **Data Fields** and **Screens** provide a powerful yet intuitive toolkit to build a custom, scalable data schema for any business process. This ensures your data is always clean, consistent, and ready to be leveraged for insights and automation.

## The Core Concepts: Fields and Screens

To model data in Luklak, you'll work with two primary components that define the structure of every `ðŸ§Š Universal Object`.

1. **Data Fields: The Building Blocks of Information**
   A `Data Field` is the smallest unit of information storage. Think of it as a specialized bucket designed to hold a specific type of dataâ€”a line of text, a number, a date, a user assignment, or a file attachment. You can create an unlimited number of custom fields to capture exactly what your process needs.
2. **Screens: The User-Facing Layout**
   A `Screen` is the visual layout or form where you organize your Data Fields. If `Data Fields` are the individual input boxes on a web form (like 'First Name', 'Email Address'), the `Screen` is the form itselfâ€”the organized layout that the user sees and interacts with when they create or view an Object.

<Info>
  The relationship is simple: You create your desired **`Data Fields`**, arrange them logically on a **`Screen`**, and then assign that `Screen` to an **`Object Type`** to define its data structure.

## A Universe of Possibilities: Field Types

Luklak offers a rich library of field types, ranging from simple inputs to powerful relational and calculated fields. Choosing the right field type is the foundation of good data architecture.

- **Basic Fields** like `Text`, `Number`, and `Date` form the backbone of most processes.
- **Relational Fields** like `User` fields to assign tasks, or `Object Lookup` fields to connect different Objects together.
- **Advanced & Calculated Fields** like `Formula` fields for dynamic calculations and `Table` fields for structured line items within an Object.

<Tip>
  Using a dedicated `Date` field for a deadline (instead of a simple `Text` field) is what enables date-based reporting, calendar views, and "Due Date Reminder" automations. Every choice has power.
