description: "A detailed guide to Luklak's 3-Tier Architecture, explaining how to use Core Blocks (Tier 1), design Functions (Tier 2), and work in Spaces (Tier 3)."

With your foundational rules of governance established in Phase 1, you are now ready to begin construction. This is the creative phase where architects and builders use Luklak's powerful components to assemble the exact operational solutions your business needs.

The entire construction process follows a simple yet robust **3-Tier Architecture**. Understanding this model is the key to building anything you can imagine on the platform.

## The 3-Tier Architecture

This model logically separates the building process into three distinct layers, from raw materials to finished, operational "buildings."

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tier 1: Core Blocks (The Raw Materials)" icon="cube" iconType="duotone">
    This is the foundational layer of building materials‚Äîthe universal "LEGO pieces" that all business processes are made from. This includes our 9 universal components:

    - **`üßä Universal Object`**: The core logical unit for any business entity.
    - **`Workflow`**: Defines the statuses and transitions to model a business process.
    - **`Data Field`**: Custom fields to capture all necessary information for an Object.
    - **`Workview`**: Customizable visual layouts (List, Kanban, Calendar) for managing Objects.
    - **`Universal Query Language (UQL)`**: A natural language-like system for querying all data across the platform.
    - **`Universal Automation`**: The platform-wide engine that connects and automates any process.
    - **`Object Connection`**: The system for creating powerful relationships between any Objects.
    - **`Unified Live Chat`**: An integrated, three-tiered communication system for perfect context.
    - **`Permission & Notification`**: Fine-grained access control and alert schemes to ensure security and awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tier 2: Function Design (The Blueprints)" icon="map" iconType="duotone">
    This is the design layer. Here, you assemble the Core Blocks into no-code designs called `üìã Functions`. A `üìã Function` is a complete operational blueprint for a specific business process, like a sales CRM or a project management system. It defines the specific `üßä Object` types, workflows, data fields, and automations required for that process.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tier 3: Usage & Operation (The Live Buildings)" icon="building" iconType="duotone">
    This is the live application layer where work actually happens. When you deploy a `üìã Function`, it becomes one or more live `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces`. This layer includes three key ways to organize and interact with work:

    - **Organizational Structure**: The hierarchy of `üìÇ Areas` and `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces` creates the official, unified structure for the entire company.
    - **Workspaces**: A flexible tool for managers to create custom command centers, pulling in work from different `Areas`.
    - **Personal Home**: An automatically aggregated view for every individual user, showing them exactly what they need to work on.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

This architecture allows for both incredible flexibility in design (Tier 2) and complete consistency in operation (Tier 3), all built upon a single, unified foundation of raw materials (Tier 1).

## What's Next?

You now have the complete roadmap for building solutions in Luklak. The logical next step is to get hands-on with your building materials.
