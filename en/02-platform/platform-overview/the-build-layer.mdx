## Why This Matters

<Info>
  Traditional business software creates invisible walls between departments. Sales data is trapped in a CRM, project updates are lost in a separate tool, and customer feedback sits isolated in another. This friction slows you down, creates data silos, and prevents your teams from working as a unified force.
</Info>

<Note>
  Luklak is fundamentally different. It's not a collection of apps‚Äîit's a single, universal foundation for building your company's entire operating system. The Build Layer is where this happens, using a powerful 3-Tier Architecture.

## The 3 Tiers of Construction

This model provides a structured way to think about building and using your solutions, moving from raw materials to a design blueprint, and finally to a live application.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tier 1: Core Blocks (The Raw Materials)" icon="cube" iconType="duotone">
    This is the foundational layer of building‚Äîthe universal "LEGO pieces" that all business processes are made from. This includes our 9 universal components which provide ultimate flexibility:

    - **`üßä Universal Object`**: The core logical unit for any business entity.
    - **`Workflow`**: Defines the statuses and transitions to model a process.
    - **`Data Fields`**: Custom fields to capture all necessary information.
    - **`Workviews`**: Customizable visual layouts (List, Kanban, etc.) for managing Objects.
    - **`Universal Query Language (UQL)`**: A system for querying all data across the platform.
    - **`Universal Automation`**: The platform-wide engine that connects and automates any process.
    - **`Object Connection`**: The system for creating powerful relationships between Objects.
    - **`Unified Live Chat`**: An integrated, three-tiered communication system.
    - **`Permission & Notification Schemes`**: Fine-grained access control and alert systems.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tier 2: Function Design (The Blueprints)" icon="map" iconType="duotone">
    This is the design layer. Here, you assemble the Core Blocks into no-code blueprints called `üìã Functions`. A `üìã Function` is a complete, reusable operational plan for a specific process, like a sales CRM or a project management system. It packages the specific `Object Types`, workflows, automations, and permissions required.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Tier 3: Usage & Operation (The Live Buildings)" icon="building" iconType="duotone">
    This is the live application layer where work actually happens. When you deploy a `üìã Function`, it becomes one or more live `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces`. This tier includes three key ways to organize and interact with work:

    - **Organizational Structure**: The official hierarchy of `üìÇ Areas` and `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces` that forms the unified structure for the entire company.
    - **Workspaces**: A flexible command center, mainly for managers, to pull together various `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces` and reports into a single, personalized view.
    - **Personal Home**: An automatically aggregated "to-do" list for every individual, collecting all their assigned `üßä Objects` and updates from across the platform.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

This architecture allows for both incredible flexibility in design (Tier 2) and complete consistency in operation (Tier 3), all built upon a single, unified foundation of Core Blocks (Tier 1).
