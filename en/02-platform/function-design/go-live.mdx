## The Go-Live Moment

You have navigated the entire 8-step design process. You have analyzed requirements, designed data models, mapped workflows, built automations, and configured security. You have a complete, tested, and validated `üìã Function` blueprint.

This guide covers the final, crucial phase: **Deployment**. This is the moment you transform your architectural plan into a real, operational workspace that your team can use to drive business value. It's the process of turning the blueprint into the building.

<Info>
  Deployment is more than just clicking a button. It's a structured process that involves creating the live environment, onboarding your team, and officially launching the new solution.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before you create a live `‚èπÔ∏è Space`, ensure your `Function` blueprint is fully prepared for launch. A quick pre-flight check guarantees a smooth deployment.

- **Final Testing Completed:** The `Function` has been thoroughly tested by both the architect and the end-users (UAT).
- **Feedback Incorporated:** All critical feedback from the testing phase has been addressed and incorporated into the design.
- **Clear Naming & Description:** The `Function` has a clear, descriptive name and a helpful description so other managers know its purpose.
- **Status is "Published":** The `Function` is marked as "Published" or "Ready for Use" in the library, making it available for selection.

## The Deployment Process

Deploying your `Function` involves two main phases: creating the workspace itself, and then populating it with the right people.

### Phase 1: Create the Live Space

This is the technical step of creating the live workspace from your blueprint.

1. **`Navigate to the Correct üìÇ Area`**
   The first step is to decide where the new workspace should live within your company's `Organizational Structure`. Go to the appropriate `Area` (e.g., "Sales Department," "Client Projects").
2. **`Select Your Function Blueprint`**
   Click the `Create Space` button. This will open the library of all available, published `Functions`. Find and select the blueprint you just finalized.
3. **`Name the Space`**
   Give your `Space` a specific, meaningful name that clearly identifies its purpose.
   - **Bad Example:** "New Project"
   - **Good Example:** "Q4 2025: Website Relaunch Initiative"

Your `Space` is now technically live, but it's an empty building. The next phase brings in your team.

### Phase 2: Onboard Your Team

This phase focuses on configuring the `Space` for your team and officially launching it for use.

# Onboarding and Launching a New Space

! Important: This process grants your team access and makes the Space their new environment for daily work.

## Section 1: Configure User Access

1.  **Navigate to Space Settings**
    Enter the `Space` you just created and go to the `Settings` or `Members` section.

2.  **Assign Users to Roles**
    This is the most critical step of onboarding. You will see the list of abstract `Roles` you designed in the `Function` (e.g., "Project Manager," "Designer," "Approver"). Your task here is to map your real `Users` and `Groups` to these `Roles`. This action is what applies the `Permission Scheme` to the actual people, granting them the correct level of access within this specific `Space`.

## Section 2: Launch and Support

1.  **(Optional) Initial Data Setup**
    If this `Space` is replacing an old system, you may need to perform an initial import of existing data.

2.  **Announce and Train**
    Formally announce the launch to the team. Send a welcome message with a direct link to the new `Space`. Provide them with any training materials you have prepared and explain the key benefits of the new system.

3.  **Monitor and Support**
    In the first few days after launch, be available to answer questions and support your team as they adapt to the new process.
```

## What's Next?

Congratulations\! Your `Function` is no longer just a blueprint; it is a live, operational solution driving value for your business. You have completed the full design and deployment lifecycle.
