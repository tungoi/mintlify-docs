## Mapping Your Process Flow

In the previous step, you established the data foundation of your `Function` by defining your `ðŸ§Š Objects` and their relationships. You know *what* you are tracking. Now, it's time to define *how* these `Objects` move through your business process from start to finish. This is the purpose of a `Workflow`.

<Info>
A well-designed `Workflow` brings clarity, standardization, and accountability to your operations. It creates a "golden path" for every `Object`, ensuring that work is handled consistently and nothing falls through the cracks. This step leverages the **Workflow** LEGO piece from Tier 1.

## The Components of a Workflow

Every `Workflow` in Luklak is built from two simple but powerful components: **Statuses** and **Transitions**.

### `Statuses`: The Stages of Your Process

A `Status` represents a specific milestone, stage, or state in the lifecycle of an `Object`. It's a snapshot in time. The naming convention for `Statuses` is `ALL CAPS` to make them easily identifiable.

**Examples:**
-   **Simple Task Workflow:** `TO DO` â†’ `IN PROGRESS` â†’ `IN REVIEW` â†’ `DONE`
-   **Sales Deal Workflow:** `NEW` â†’ `QUALIFIED` â†’ `DEMO SCHEDULED` â†’ `PROPOSAL SENT` â†’ `CLOSED-WON`

### `Transitions`: The Paths Between Stages

A `Transition` is the defined, one-way path that moves an `Object` from one `Status` to another. In the user interface, `Transitions` appear as action buttons on an `Object`. You are not just defining the path, but also the action the user takes to move along that path.

**Example:**
To move an `Object` from the `IN REVIEW` Status to the `DONE` Status, you might create a `Transition` named "Approve & Complete". This will appear as an "Approve & Complete" button for users to click.

`[IN REVIEW]` --- (*Click "Approve & Complete" button*) ---> `[DONE]`

## Designing Your Workflow in Luklak

The `Workflow` designer is a visual, drag-and-drop canvas that makes it easy to map out even the most complex processes. You will create a unique `Workflow` for each `Object Type` in your `Function`.

# Tutorial: Building a Visual Workflow

! Important: Each Object Type in your Function can have its own unique Workflow.

## Section 1: Laying Out Your Statuses

1.  **Open the Workflow Designer**
    In your `Function`'s design canvas, select the `Object Type` you want to build a process for (e.g., "Deal") and navigate to the `Workflow` tab.

2.  **Add Your Statuses**
    Drag `Status` nodes from the side panel onto the canvas. Name them according to the process you mapped out in Step 1 (e.g., `NEW`, `QUALIFIED`, `PROPOSAL SENT`).

3.  **Set the Starting Status**
    Select one `Status` (usually `NEW` or `TO DO`) and designate it as the initial `Status` for all newly created `Objects`.

## Section 2: Connecting with Transitions

1.  **Create a Transition**
    Click on the edge of a `Status` node and drag the arrow to a subsequent `Status` node. This creates a `Transition` path.

2.  **Configure the Transition**
    Click on the transition arrow you just created. In the configuration panel, give it a clear, action-oriented name. This name will appear on the button for users (e.g., "Mark as Qualified").

3.  **Build the Full Flow**
    Continue adding all your `Statuses` and `Transitions` until your complete business process is visually represented on the canvas.
