## From Idea to Live Solution

Building a powerful business solution isn't magic—it's a structured process. While Luklak's no-code platform gives you incredible speed and flexibility, following a proven methodology ensures that the solutions you build are well-planned, robust, secure, and ultimately adopted by your users.

<Info>
  This 8-step design process is Luklak's official playbook for architects and builders. It will guide you from a raw business idea all the way to a live, deployed `⏹️ Space` where your team can start working immediately.

Follow these steps sequentially to transform your vision into a reality. Each step builds upon the last, resulting in a complete and cohesive solution.
