## From Bricks to Blueprints

In the previous section, we introduced the Tier 1 "LEGO¬Æ Bricks"‚Äîthe nine universal components that form the foundation of any process in Luklak. While powerful, these raw materials need a plan to become a useful solution.

This is where you, the architect, step in. Tier 2 is all about **design**, and its single most important concept is the `üìã Function`.

<Info>
A `üìã Function` is the master **blueprint** for a complete business solution. It is a container where you assemble and configure the universal LEGO pieces from Tier 1 to solve a specific business problem, such as managing a sales pipeline, tracking job candidates, or running an IT helpdesk.

## The Blueprint and the Building

The relationship between a `Function` and a `‚èπÔ∏è Space` is the most critical concept in Tier 2.

  <Card title="The Blueprint: üìã Function" icon="map" iconType="duotone">
    This is the design canvas where you define all the logic. You connect `Object Types`, design `Workflows`, build `Automations`, and set `Permission Schemes`. **No live work happens here.** A Function is a reusable, inactive plan.
  </Card>
  <Card title="The Building: ‚èπÔ∏è Space" icon="table-layout" iconType="duotone">
    This is the live, operational workspace created *from* your Function blueprint. This is where your team interacts with real data, moves `üßä Objects`, and collaborates every day. You can create countless `Spaces` from a single `Function`.
  </Card>

## Anatomy of a Function

When you design a `üìã Function`, you are packaging the core LEGO pieces into a single, cohesive unit. A complete blueprint defines:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Objects" icon="cube" iconType="duotone">
    The core data entities of your process (e.g., `Leads`, `Deals`) and the `Connections` that link them together.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Screens" icon="pen-field" iconType="duotone">
    The precise `Data Fields` needed to capture information, arranged logically into `Screens` for data entry.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workflows" icon="arrow-progress" iconType="duotone">
    The standardized processes that your `Objects` must follow, defined by visual maps of `Statuses` and `Transitions`.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automations" icon="robot" iconType="duotone">
    The operational nervous system that connects steps, updates data, and eliminates manual handoffs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workviews, Dashboards & Filters" icon="table-columns" iconType="duotone">
    The user interface layers, including `Workviews` for daily tasks and `Dashboards` with `Saved Filters` for analysis.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Roles" icon="user-tag" iconType="duotone">
    The abstract definition of the actors in your process, such as "Project Manager", "Approver", or "Assignee".
  </Card>
  <Card title="Permission Scheme" icon="user-shield" iconType="duotone">
    The security matrix defining *who* can do *what*. It maps `Roles` to specific `Actions` (e.g., only "Approvers" can edit).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Notification Scheme" icon="bell" iconType="duotone">
    The awareness layer defining *who* gets notified about *which* actions, ensuring teams stay informed without noise.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Controlling the Blueprint

A `Function` itself is a valuable piece of intellectual property. Therefore, it has its own `Item Access` controls, separate from the permissions *within* the blueprint. This allows administrators to define who can:
-   **Use** the Function to create new `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces`.
-   **Manage** or **Edit** the design of the Function blueprint itself.

<Tip>
This ensures architectural integrity. You can allow many team leaders to create `Spaces` from an approved "Project Management" Function, while only allowing a select few architects to modify the underlying blueprint. For a full guide, see our documentation on [Item Access Management](/platform/core-concepts/permissions/item-access-management).
</Tip>

## What's Next?

Understanding the `Function` concept is the key to moving from a user to a builder. Now that you've grasped the "what," you're ready to learn the "how."
