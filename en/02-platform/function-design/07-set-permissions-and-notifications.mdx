## Securing Your Process

Your `üìã Function` now has a data model, a workflow, automations, and a user interface. This final design step is one of the most critical: securing the entire process to ensure the right people have the right access‚Äîand the right awareness‚Äîat all times.

This step involves two distinct activities: first, defining the "cast of characters" (`Roles`) specific to your process, and second, assigning them their script (`Permission` and `Notification Schemes`).

<Info>
  Remember, this step is about **applying** governance, not building it from scratch. You will be using the `Permission & Notification Schemes` that were designed as a Tier 1 LEGO piece.

## Phase 1: Defining Function-Specific Roles

While your system has `Global Roles` (like Admin, Manager, Member), most business processes have their own unique set of actors. In this phase, you define these process-specific `Roles`.

Think of `Roles` as the job titles within your `Function's` process. For a "Recruitment" `Function`, you might create `Roles` such as:

- `Hiring Manager`
- `Recruiter`
- `Interviewer`
- `Compensation Approver`

These `Roles` act as placeholders. You are defining the parts that need to be played. Later, when a `‚èπÔ∏è Space` is created from this `Function`, real `Users` or `Groups` will be assigned to fill these parts.

<Tip>
  This approach makes your `Function` incredibly reusable. The same `Function` can be used by different departments, each mapping their own people to the same set of defined `Roles`. To refresh your understanding of how `Roles` work, see our foundational guide on [Users, Groups, and Roles](/platform/core-concepts/permissions/users-groups-roles).

## Phase 2: Applying Permission & Notification Schemes

Once your `Roles` are defined, you apply the rules that govern their behavior. This is done by selecting the appropriate `Permission` and `Notification Schemes` for your `Function`.

### Choosing a Permission Scheme

A `Permission Scheme` defines **who can do what**. In your `Function`'s settings, you will select a scheme (either a built-in one like "Strict Access" or a custom one) from a dropdown. This scheme's rules will then be mapped to the `Roles` you just created.

**Example:**

1. You select the **"Strict Access"** `Permission Scheme`.
2. This scheme contains a rule: "Only the `Role` named 'Approver' can perform the `Transition` 'Approve Offer'."
3. In your `Function`, you have created a `Role` called `Compensation Approver`.
4. The system now understands that only the user(s) assigned to the `Compensation Approver` `Role` in a live `Space` will see the "Approve Offer" button.

### Choosing a Notification Scheme

Similarly, a `Notification Scheme` defines **who knows what**. You will select a scheme that dictates which actions trigger alerts for which `Roles`.

**Example:**

1. You select the **"Notify key actions to key assignees"** `Notification Scheme`.
2. This scheme has a rule: "When an `Object`'s `Status` changes, send a notification to the `Role` 'Manager'."
3. In your `Function`, you've defined the `Hiring Manager` `Role`.
4. Now, every time a `Candidate` `Object` changes status, the user mapped to the `Hiring Manager` `Role` will automatically receive a notification.

<Info>
  This guide focuses on **applying** schemes within a `Function`. If the standard schemes don't fit and you need to design a complex, custom scheme from the ground up, refer to our detailed guides:

  - [Creating Custom Notification Schemes](/platform/core-concepts/permissions/notification-schemes)

## What's Next?

Congratulations, your `Function` blueprint is now complete\! You've defined the entire process from data structure to security. The final step is to ensure everything works as expected before launching it to your teams.
