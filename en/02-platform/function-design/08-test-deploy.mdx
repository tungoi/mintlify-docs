## From Blueprint to Reality

You have designed a complete business solution blueprint, from its data structure and workflows to its security and user interface. This final, critical step ensures that your carefully crafted `ðŸ“‹ Function` transitions smoothly from a design into a live, valuable, and well-adopted operational workspace for your team.

The go-live phase consists of three key activities: **Testing**, **Iterating** based on feedback, and finally, **Deploying** the solution.

## Phase 1: Test for Quality and Usability

Thorough testing is about more than just finding bugs; it's about validating that the solution you built truly solves the business problem you identified in Step 1.

    This is your own internal quality check as the builder. Before showing it to anyone else, create a temporary test `Space` from your `Function` and run through a checklist:

    - Do all `Workflow Transitions` work as expected?
    - Do all `Automations` fire correctly?
    - Do the `Permission Schemes` properly allow and restrict actions?
    - Do `Dashboards` calculate and display data accurately?
  </Card>
  <Card title="User Acceptance Testing (UAT)" icon="users" iconType="duotone">
    This is where you validate the solution with its future users. Involve the stakeholders you interviewed in Step 1. Don't just ask them to "try it out"â€”give them specific, real-world scenarios to complete.

    <br />

    <br />

    **Example Scenario:** "Using the new system, create a `Candidate` profile for John Doe, schedule an `Interview` for next Tuesday, and then move the `Candidate` to the `INTERVIEW SCHEDULED` status."

## Phase 2: Iterate Based on Feedback

Testing will inevitably generate feedback. Treat this feedback as a giftâ€”it's your opportunity to refine the solution before its official launch. A key advantage of the Luklak platform is the ability to iterate with incredible speed.

<Info>
  Because you are working with a no-code `Function` blueprint, you can often make changes based on feedback in minutes, not weeks. A user finds a screen layout confusing? Adjust it. An automation feels clunky? Tweak its logic. You can make refinements and have your users test the updated version almost immediately.

## Phase 3: Deploy Your Solution

Once testing is complete and all feedback has been addressed, you are ready for the official launch. Deployment is a straightforward, multi-step process.

# Go-Live Checklist

! Important: This process will make your new solution available for your team to use for their daily work.

## Section 1: Launch the Live Workspace

1.  **Finalize the Function Blueprint**
    Give your `Function` a final review in the design canvas. Ensure it has a clear name, description, and is marked as "Published" or "Ready for Use".

2.  **Create the Live Space**
    Navigate to the `ðŸ“‚ Area` where the new workspace should live and click `Create Space`. Select your newly designed `Function` from the list of available blueprints. Give the `Space` a name (e.g., "Q4 Sales Pipeline").

## Section 2: Onboard Your Team

1.  **Assign Users to Roles**
    In your new `Space`'s settings, navigate to the `Roles` section. Here, you will map your real `Users` and `Groups` to the `Function Roles` you designed (e.g., assign "Alice Smith" to the "Project Manager" `Role`).

2.  **Announce and Train**
    Formally announce the launch to the team. Provide them with a link to the new `Space` and any user guides you have prepared. Your solution is now live!
```

## What's Next?

Congratulations\! You have successfully navigated the entire 8-step Function Design process and launched a new, powerful solution for your team. You have turned an idea into a reality.
