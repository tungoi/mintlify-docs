## Layer 1: Core LEGO pieces

### Universal Object

<Tip>
  <Icon icon="cube" iconType="duotone" color="#358AFF" /> **Universal Object** is the central LEGO piece, the heart that standardizes 100% of business data. Everything shares one data pool, the same language, and can be leveraged long-term for multiple purposes.
