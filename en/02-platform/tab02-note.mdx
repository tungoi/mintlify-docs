11. **Item Access / License Management**
    - **JTBD:** _When I manage Luklak usage in the enterprise, I want to understand how Luklak manages user licenses, different license types (if any), and how it affects access to certain Functions or features, to optimize costs and ensure everyone has appropriate access._
    - **Key Takeaway:** "You will grasp Luklak's user license management mechanism, how it relates to Function and feature access rights, and how to manage user counts effectively."

### **B. Tier 2: Function Design**

1. **What is a Function? Packaging Business Logic**
   - **JTBD:** _When I want to build a solution for a specific business process (e.g., recruitment management, CRM), I need to understand what a "Function" in Luklak is and why it's important, so I can start packaging logic and data in an organized way._
   - **Key Takeaway:** "You will understand a Function as a complete 'blueprint' for a business category, including related Object Types, Workflows, Data fields, Automation, Permissions and Interfaces, which can be reused and deployed as specific Spaces."

   - **Key Takeaway:** "You will learn how to manage who has permission to use (deploy) a Function, and how to share (export/import) Function designs between accounts or with the community."

### **C. Tier 3: Using & Operating Luklak**

_(This section focuses on how end users and managers interact with components that have been designed and deployed.)_

1. **Organizing Work with Areas and Spaces**
   - **JTBD:** _When I start working or managing a team on Luklak, I want to understand what "Areas" and "Spaces" are, how they help organize work, and how to create/join them, so I have a clear and efficient workspace._
   - **Key Takeaway:** "You will understand that a Space is where a specific Function is deployed for work (e.g., 'Sales Team CRM' Space), and an Area is a way to group related Spaces together (e.g., 'Business' Area)."
