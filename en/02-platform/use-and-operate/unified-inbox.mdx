## Your Personal Mission Control

<Info>
  In a busy system with many projects, notifications can quickly become overwhelming. The **Unified Inbox** is your personal mission control, designed to tame the chaos by intelligently gathering every important update and communication relevant _to you_ from across the entire platform.

### Part of a Multi-Channel System

The Unified Inbox is the central hub for managing notifications, but it's part of a larger system designed to keep you informed in different ways:

- **Real-time Alerts:** Fleeting **Toast** and **Push Notifications** that alert you of an event instantly.
- **Quick View:** A **Notification Bell** in the main menu for a quick glance at the latest updates without leaving your current screen.
- **Central Hub:** The **Unified Inbox** is where you go to permanently view, manage, and act on all your notifications in one dedicated place.

  While other alerts keep you aware in the moment, the Unified Inbox is your dedicated space to process, organize, and respond to every update that requires your attention.

## What Appears in Your Inbox?

Your inbox is a smart, curated feed of "Activity Updates" from various sources, not just a simple list of messages. You will see:

- **`Object Updates:`** Any significant activity on `Objects` you are involved in, including status changes, data updates, and new `Object Chat` messages.
- **`Space Updates:`** New messages from the `Space Chat` of the `Spaces` you belong to.
- `System Updates`**:** Automatic notifications generated by `Universal Automation` rules or alerts from `Saved Filters`.

## Mastering the Inbox Interface

The key to an effective inbox is active management. The interface is designed to help you quickly filter, understand, and act on your notifications.

# Tutorial: Mastering Your Inbox

! Important: Your Unified Inbox is completely private. You are the only one who sees this curated view.

## Section 1: Filtering and Focusing Your View

1.  **Use the Primary Filters**
    At the top of the inbox, use the main filters to change your view:
    * **Notifications:** The default view of all incoming updates.
    * **@mentions:** Shows only conversations where you were directly mentioned. This is your highest-priority view.
    * **My Interactions:** A smart filter that shows updates from `Objects` and conversations you have recently participated in.

2.  **Control the Detail Level**
    Switch between two display modes:
    * **Latest:** (Default) A clean view that shows only the most recent update for each `Object`.
    * **Detailed:** Shows every single update for every `Object`. This is comprehensive but can be noisy.

## Section 2: Taking Action on Notifications

1.  **Jump Directly to Context**
    Click on any notification in the list. This action will instantly take you to the exact `Object` or `Space Chat` where the event happened, giving you the full context to understand and respond.

2.  **Reply and Interact**
    From the source, you can reply to the message or update the `Object` as needed.

3.  **Mark as Read**
    After you have handled a notification, mark it as "Read". This is the key to maintaining a clean, "inbox zero" state, ensuring that your inbox only shows what still needs your attention.
