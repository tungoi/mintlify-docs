## Your Team's Central Hub

Whether you click a link from your `Personal Home` or navigate through the `Organizational Structure`, you will eventually land in a `‚èπÔ∏è Space`. A `Space` is the central hub where you and your team collaborate on a specific project or process.

While every `Space` is configured for a unique purpose, they all share a consistent layout. Once you understand the main components of one `Space`, you can confidently navigate any other.

<Info>
This guide is a high-level tour of the `Space` interface. We'll introduce each major component here and provide links to more detailed guides on how to master each one.

## The Main Components of a Space

When you enter a `Space`, you will find several key areas designed for different types of work.

### The Main Work Area: `Workviews`

The `Workviews` section is the heart of a `Space`. This is where you will find and interact with the actual list of `üßä Objects` (e.g., tasks, deals, tickets). This is where you *do* your work.

A `Space` can have multiple `Workviews`, appearing as tabs at the top. Your `Function` architect has designed these views to present the information in the most useful way for your team's process. Common `Workviews` include:
-   **List:** For a dense, spreadsheet-like view.
-   **Kanban:** For a visual, card-based view of your workflow.
-   **Calendar:** For a date-based view of your work.

‚û°Ô∏è **To learn how to interact with the items in these views, see our guide on [Managing Objects](/use-and-operate/working-with-objects).**

### The Analytical View: `Dashboards`

The `Dashboards` tab is where you go to *analyze* your work. Instead of a list of individual tasks, you will find charts, graphs, and key metrics that provide a high-level overview of the `Space`'s progress and performance. This area helps you answer the question, "How are we doing?".

‚û°Ô∏è **To learn how to interact with these reports, see our guide on [Gaining Insights with Reports & Dashboards](/use-and-operate/reports-and-dashboards).**

### The Communication Channel: `Space Chat`

Every `Space` has its own dedicated chat channel, typically located in a panel on the side. This is the place for team-level conversations, announcements, general questions, and sharing files related to the `Space`'s overall objective.

‚û°Ô∏è **For a deep dive on communication tools, see our guide on [Effective Team Collaboration](/use-and-operate/collaboration).**

### The Focusing Tool: `Filters`

Within both `Workviews` and `Dashboards`, you will find `Filter` capabilities. These tools allow you to narrow down the amount of information displayed so you can focus only on what's relevant to you at that moment. You can use the `Quick Filter` bar for on-the-fly sorting or apply powerful, pre-built `Saved Filters`.

‚û°Ô∏è **To master all the ways you can find information, read our guide on [Finding Information with Search & Filters](/use-and-operate/search-and-filter).**

## What's Next?

You now have a map of your primary workspace and know the purpose of each key area. The next logical step is to learn the details of managing the individual work items within the `Workviews`.
