## What is an Object?

Everything you work on in Luklak‚Äîa sales deal, a project task, a support ticket, a job candidate‚Äîis an `üßä Object`. An `Object` is a single, trackable item that contains all the data and conversation related to that piece of work.

Your daily work will primarily revolve around interacting with these `Objects` inside a `‚èπÔ∏è Space`. This guide will walk you through the three fundamental actions you will perform every day: viewing data, updating information, and moving work forward.

## Viewing an Object

To start, simply click on any `Object` card from a `Workview` (like a List or Kanban board) to open its detailed view. Here, you will see all the information associated with it, neatly organized on its **Data Screen**. This screen is the single source of truth for that work item, showing you everything from the assignee and due date to its full history of changes and conversations.

## Updating Information

As you work on an `Object`, you'll need to update its information. This is as simple as clicking on a field and entering the new data.

    Click on any field, such as "Status," "Due Date," or a text description, to edit it. Your changes are saved automatically, creating a clear audit trail of who changed what, and when.

    Use the integrated `Object Chat` panel to add comments, ask questions, or provide updates. This keeps all conversations directly attached to the work itself, eliminating the need to search through emails or other chat apps.

## Moving Work Forward with Transitions

This is the most important action you will take to show progress. You don't just change a `Status` field manually. Instead, you move an `Object` from one stage of its `Workflow` to the next by clicking **Transition buttons**.

<Info>
  A `Transition` is an action button (e.g., "Start Progress," "Submit for Review," "Mark as Complete") that moves an `Object` to the next logical `Status`. These buttons are pre-configured in the `Function` blueprint to ensure work always follows the correct process.

# Tutorial: Moving an Object Through Its Workflow

! Important: The available Transition buttons will change depending on the Object's current Status.

## Section 1: Progressing a Task

1.  **Open an Object**
    From a `Workview`, click on an `Object` that is assigned to you. For this example, its `Status` is `TO DO`.

2.  **Find the Transition Buttons**
    Look at the top of the `Object` detail view. You will see the available action buttons for its current `Status`. In this case, you might see a "Start Progress" button.

3.  **Click the Transition**
    Click the "Start Progress" button. The `Object`'s `Status` will instantly update to `IN PROGRESS`.

## Section 2: Completing the Task

1.  **View New Transitions**
    Now that the `Object` is `IN PROGRESS`, a new set of `Transition` buttons will appear, such as "Submit for Review".

2.  **Complete the Process**
    Continue to perform your work and click the appropriate `Transition` buttons to move the `Object` through each stage of its `Workflow` until it reaches a final `Status` like `DONE` or `ARCHIVED`.
