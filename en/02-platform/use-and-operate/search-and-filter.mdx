## Find What You Need, Instantly

As your company's work grows within Luklak, being able to find specific information quickly becomes essential. Luklak provides two primary tools to help you locate exactly what you're looking for: **Global Search** for finding a specific item anywhere, and **Filters** for focusing your view on items that meet certain criteria.

## Global Search: Your Platform-Wide Finder

Think of Global Search as your "needle in a haystack" finder. When you know a keyword, ID, or name of a specific `üßä Object` and want to find it instantly, regardless of which `‚èπÔ∏è Space` it's in, Global Search is your best tool.

The search bar is always available at the top of your screen. Simply type what you're looking for‚Äîan `Object` ID like `TICKET-1234`, a customer's name, or a keyword from a description‚Äîand Luklak will show you all matching results from across the entire platform.

## Filters: Focusing Your Workview

While Global Search finds one specific thing, Filters help you see a specific _group_ of things within the `Workview` you're currently looking at. They allow you to temporarily hide the `Objects` you don't need to see so you can focus on what's important.

### Quick Filters

The Quick Filter bar appears at the top of every `Workview` (like a List or Kanban board). It allows you to perform simple, on-the-fly filtering based on the columns you see.

**Use Case:** You're looking at a project's task list and want to see only the tasks assigned to you. You can click on the `Assignee` column header in the Quick Filter bar and select your name. The list will instantly update to show only your tasks.

### Saved Filters

`Saved Filters` are powerful, pre-built filter sets created by the `Function` architect to answer common business questions. They allow you to apply complex criteria with a single click.

You can find `Saved Filters` in a dropdown menu on your `Workview`. Examples an architect might create include:

- My High-Priority Tasks
- Deals Closing This Quarter
- Bugs Reported in the Last 7 Days
- Overdue Invoices

<Info>
  `Saved Filters` are powered by the **Universal Query Language (UQL)**, the smart query engine behind Luklak. While you can apply them with one click, architects define their complex logic during `Function` Design. To learn more about the power behind these filters, see our guide on the [UQL Core Concept](/platform/core-concepts/uql).

# Tutorial: Using Filters in a Workview

! Important: Filters you apply are temporary and only affect your own view, not your teammates'.

## Section 1: Applying a Quick Filter

1.  **Navigate to a Workview**
    Open any `Space` and go to a `Workview`, such as the "All Tasks" List view.

2.  **Use the Quick Filter Bar**
    At the top of the list, locate the Quick Filter bar. Click on the `Status` header.

3.  **Select a Value**
    From the dropdown, check the box next to `IN PROGRESS`. The `Workview` will instantly update to show only the `Objects` that have the "IN PROGRESS" status.

## Section 2: Using a Saved Filter

1.  **Find the Saved Filters Menu**
    Near the top of the `Workview`, locate the `Filters` dropdown menu.

2.  **Select a Saved Filter**
    Click the dropdown to see a list of pre-built filters. Select one, such as "My Overdue Tasks". The `Workview` will immediately apply the complex criteria of that filter.

## What's Next?

Being able to find and focus on your work is a key skill. Once you've filtered your view to see the right data, the next step is often to analyze and report on it.
