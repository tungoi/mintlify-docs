## Your Digital Office Structure

As introduced in the overview, the **Organizational Structure** is the official company-wide map for all work. It provides a shared, hierarchical view so everyone knows where to find different teams and processes. This structure is built from two simple components: `üìÇ Areas` and `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces`.

</Frame>

Think of it like a digital filing cabinet:

- An **`üìÇ Area`** is the cabinet drawer, used to group related topics (e.g., "Finance Department," "Marketing Projects").
- A **`‚èπÔ∏è Space`** is a specific folder inside that drawer, dedicated to a single project or process (e.g., "Q4 Budgeting," "New Website Launch").

## `üìÇ Areas`: Grouping Your Workstreams

An `Area` is a high-level container used to group multiple, related `Spaces`. The primary purpose of an `Area` is to bring organizational clarity. You can create `Areas` that mirror your company's structure, such as departments, long-term initiatives, or client portfolios. As a manager, you can create new `Areas` and move `Spaces` between them to keep your digital workspace tidy and intuitive.

## `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces`: The Live Work Environment

A `‚èπÔ∏è Space` is the most important concept in daily operations. It is the actual, live environment where your team collaborates to get work done on `üßä Objects`.

<Info>
  The most critical thing to remember is that every `Space` is created from a `üìã Function` blueprint. The `Space` inherits all the logic‚Äîthe `Workflows`, `Data Fields`, `Automations`, and `Roles`‚Äîthat was designed in the `Function`. The `Function` is the plan; the `Space` is the real building where work happens.

## How to Create and Manage a Space

As a manager, one of your key tasks is to create and configure `Spaces` for your team.

# Tutorial: Creating and Configuring a New Space

! Important: You must have the necessary permissions to create a Space within a specific Area.

## Section 1: Create a New Space

1.  **Navigate to an Area**
    From the main navigation panel, go to the `üìÇ Area` where your new workspace should live (e.g., "Projects Department").

2.  **Create from a Function**
    Click the `+` button or `Create Space`. This will open a library of available `üìã Function` blueprints. Select the one that matches your need (e.g., "Standard Project Plan").
    ![The Function library showing various blueprints like "Sales CRM," "Project Plan," etc.](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x600.png/000000/FFFFFF?text=Step%202:%20Select%20a%20Function)

3.  **Name Your Space**
    Give your `Space` a specific, descriptive name that your team will easily recognize (e.g., "2025 Website Relaunch Project").

## Section 2: Configure the Space

1.  **Navigate to Space Settings**
    Once the `Space` is created, click on its name, then find the `Settings` or `Members` tab.

2.  **Assign Users to Roles**
    This is the most crucial configuration step. You will see a list of the `Roles` that were defined in the `Function` (e.g., "Project Manager," "Team Member"). Your job is to map your actual `Users` and `Groups` to these `Roles`. This act is what grants them the correct permissions within this specific `Space`.

```

## Create Flexible Collaboration Rooms with Workspaces

<Tip>
  

  The `üìÇ Area` and `‚èπÔ∏è Space` hierarchy provides a clear, official map for your whole company. But what about projects that span multiple departments?

  This is where **Workspaces** provide powerful flexibility. A Workspace is a personal or team-based dashboard that lets you group shortcuts to `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces`, reports, and filtered views from across the entire organization‚Äîall in one place.

  For instance, you could create a "Q4 Product Launch" Workspace that pulls in:

  - The "Campaign Plan" `‚èπÔ∏è Space` from the `üìÇ Marketing Area`.
  - The "Supplier Contracts" `‚èπÔ∏è Space` from the `üìÇ Finance Area`.
  - A real-time report on development progress.

  This doesn't move or change the official location of those `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces`. It simply creates a convenient, cross-functional view for you and your project team, giving you a focused command center for a specific initiative.

You now know how to structure your team's workspace by creating `Spaces` from `Functions`. The next step is to understand the daily activities that happen _inside_ these `Spaces`.
