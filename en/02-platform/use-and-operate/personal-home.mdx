## Your Daily Starting Point

In a busy organization, your work can be spread across many different `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces` and projects. Jumping between them just to figure out what you need to do can be overwhelming.

Your **Personal Home** is the solution. It is your personal command center, designed to answer one simple question every morning: **"What do I need to do today?"**

<Card title="Personal Home" icon="house-user" iconType="duotone">
  It automatically finds and organizes everything that needs your attention from across the entire platform, giving you a single, clear place to start your day. It is your personal "You Are Here" dot on the company map.

## What You'll Find in Your Personal Home

Your Personal Home is composed of several useful sections, each designed to give you a different slice of your work life.

  <Card title="Unified Inbox" icon="inbox" iconType="duotone">
    This is your personal communication hub. It gathers all your **@mentions** and important notifications from every `Object` and `Space`. Check here first to see what requires your immediate response.
  </Card>
  <Card title="My Work" icon="user-check" iconType="duotone">
    This is your dynamic, personal to-do list. It automatically displays every `üßä Object` from every `Space` where you are listed as the **assignee**. You can sort and filter this list to prioritize your tasks for the day.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Starred Items" icon="star" iconType="duotone">
    This is your personal list of bookmarks. You can "star" any important `Object`, `Space`, or even a key `Message` to add it to this list for quick access later. This is your curated list of what's most important to you.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Recently Viewed" icon="clock-rotate-left" iconType="duotone">
    A simple but powerful list of the `Objects`, `Spaces`, and other items you've recently visited. Use this to quickly jump back into whatever you were working on last.

## How to Use Your Personal Home Effectively

Make your Personal Home the first page you visit every day to build an efficient routine.

# A Typical Morning Routine with Personal Home

! Important: Your Personal Home is private and customized for you. No one else sees your unique view.

## Section 1: Review and Plan

1.  **Check Your Inbox**
    Start your day by reviewing the `Unified Inbox`. Respond to any urgent `@mentions` to unblock your teammates.

2.  **Scan 'My Work'**
    Navigate to the `My Work` section. Sort your assigned `Objects` by the "Due Date" field to see what deadlines are approaching. You can also filter for high-priority items.

## Section 2: Execute Your Tasks

1.  **Launch into Your Work**
    Click on the first `Object` from your prioritized "My Work" list. This will take you directly to that `Object`, even if it's in a completely different `Space`.

2.  **Work and Star Important Items**
    As you work, if a colleague mentions a critical document or you come across an `Object` you'll need to reference frequently, simply click the `Star` icon. It will now be available in your `Personal Home` for easy retrieval.
