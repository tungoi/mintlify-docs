## Taming Cross-Functional Complexity

As a manager, your responsibilities often span multiple projects, teams, and processes, each living in its own dedicated `⏹️ Space`. Constantly switching between these `Spaces` to get a high-level overview can be inefficient.

This is the exact problem a **Workspace** is designed to solve. It is your private, customizable command center that lets you pull together all the scattered pieces of information that matter to you into a single, unified view.

  A flexible command center designed for managers. A Workspace allows you to pull together different `⏹️ Spaces`, `Dashboards`, and `Filters` from across the organization for convenient cross-functional monitoring.

## Workspace vs. Space vs. Personal Home

It's crucial to understand the difference between these three environments: 

- **`⏹️ Space:`** A **team's** official, shared workspace where work is done. Its structure is defined by a `Function`.
- **`Personal Home:`** An **individual's** _automatic_ to-do list, aggregating all their assigned tasks and notifications.
- **`Workspace:`** A **manager's** _manually curated_, private dashboard for monitoring and quick access. It's a view you build for yourself.

## Building Your Command Center

A `Workspace` is like a blank canvas where you can add shortcuts and live "gadgets" from anywhere in Luklak.

**What can you add to a Workspace?**

- **`Shortcuts to Spaces:`** Pin your most frequently visited `Spaces` for one-click access.
- **`Embedded Dashboards:`** Display a full `Dashboard` from a critical `Space` directly on your `Workspace` canvas.
- **`Embedded Saved Filters:`** Add a gadget that shows a live, filtered list of `Objects`, such as "All Overdue Tasks Across My Department" or "All High-Value Deals Closing This Month".

# Tutorial: Creating Your First Workspace

! Important: Workspaces are private by default. You can choose to share them with specific colleagues if needed.

## Section 1: Create a New Workspace

1.  **Navigate to the Workspaces Section**
    In the main navigation menu of Luklak, find and click on the `Workspaces` icon.

2.  **Create Your Workspace**
    Click `Create New Workspace` and give it a name that reflects its purpose, such as "My Department Overview" or "Key Client Monitoring".

## Section 2: Customize Your Workspace

1.  **Enter Edit Mode**
    Inside your new Workspace, click the `Customize` or `Add Item` button to enter edit mode.

2.  **Add Your First Gadget**
    A library of available items will appear. Let's add a `Dashboard` from a `Space`. Search for the `Space` you want, then select the specific `Dashboard` you wish to embed.

3.  **Arrange Your Layout**
    Once added, you can drag and resize the `Dashboard` gadget on your `Workspace` canvas. Continue adding shortcuts to `Spaces` and other gadgets until you have the perfect command center view.

## What's Next?

You now understand all three work environments in Luklak—the formal `Organizational Structure`, your personal to-do list in `Personal Home`, and your custom `Workspace` for monitoring. Next, let's take a tour of the most common environment: the `Space`.
