## Your Office in Your Pocket

<Info>
  The mobile app is optimized for the most common daily tasks: checking updates, collaborating with your team, and managing work on the go. Complex configuration and `üìã Function` design are best done on the web application.

## Core Features on Mobile

The mobile app puts the most critical operational features at your fingertips.

### 1. Stay Informed on the Move

The app experience is designed to help you quickly see what's new. The default screen is often your `Personal Home` or `Unified Inbox`, showing you the latest `@mentions` and task assignments. **Push Notifications** will alert you to important updates in real-time, which you can configure in the app's settings.

### 2. Manage Work from Anywhere

You can easily navigate to any `‚èπÔ∏è Space` and `Workview` to see your team's `üßä Objects`. From the app, you can:

- Tap to open an `Object` and view all its data.
- Quickly edit key `Data Fields`.
- Use `Transition` buttons to move work forward through its `Workflow`.

### 3. Collaborate in Real-Time

Communication is central to the mobile experience. You can:

- Use `Object Chat` and `Space Chat` to stay in the loop.
- Send messages and `@mention` colleagues.
- Upload photos and files directly from your phone to a task or conversation.

### 4. Capture Ideas Instantly

The mobile app is perfect for capturing tasks and ideas on the fly. Use the "quick create" button to instantly add a new `üßä Object` without having to navigate to a specific `Space` first. You can categorize it and add details later.
