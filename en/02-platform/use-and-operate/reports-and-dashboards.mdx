## From Data to Decisions

While `Workviews` are for _doing_ the work, `Dashboards` are for _understanding_ it. They are the analytical canvases within your `‚èπÔ∏è Space` that transform the raw data from your team's daily activities into clear, visual insights.

This guide will teach you how to read, interact with, and get data out of the `Dashboards` that have been designed for your team's processes. This is how you move from just tracking work to making data-driven decisions.

<Info>
  The `Dashboards` in your `Space` were designed by an architect as part of the `üìã Function` blueprint. They are pre-configured to show the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics that are most important for your specific project or process.

## Reading a Dashboard

A `Dashboard` is composed of various "gadgets," each designed to show information in a different way. Common gadgets you will encounter include:

- **Charts (Bar, Pie, Line):** Used to visualize trends over time, compare categories, or see proportions.
- **Counters & Calculations:** Display important totals at a glance, like "Total Revenue This Quarter" or "Average Ticket Resolution Time."
- **Object Lists:** Show a specific, filtered list of `üßä Objects`, such as "All High-Priority Overdue Tasks" or "Recently Closed Deals."

## Interacting with Your Data

The most powerful aspect of a `Dashboard` is that it's not a static image‚Äîit's an interactive tool for exploration. You can filter, drill down, and export data to answer specific questions.

# Tutorial: Analyzing Data on a Dashboard

! Important: Filtering a Dashboard only affects your own view and does not change what your teammates see.

## Section 1: Filtering the Dashboard

1.  **Locate the Dashboard Filters**
    At the top of the `Dashboard`, you will find a set of filter controls, such as `Date Range` or `Assignee`.

2.  **Apply a Filter**
    Select a value from one of the filters. For example, choose a specific user from the `Assignee` filter. All gadgets on the `Dashboard` will instantly update to show data related only to that person.

## Section 2: Drilling Down and Exporting

1.  **Drill Down into Data**
    Hover over a segment of a chart (like a single bar in a bar chart). Often, you can click on it to "drill down" and see a filtered list of the specific `Objects` that make up that data point.

2.  **Export a Report**
    Hover over a gadget, such as an `Object List`, and click the `...` (More actions) menu. Select the `Export to CSV` option to download the data from that specific gadget for offline analysis in a spreadsheet.
