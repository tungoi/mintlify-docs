## Conversation in Context

In many companies, work happens in one application while conversations about that work happen in another (like email or a separate chat app). This creates a disconnect, making it hard to find important decisions and files later.

Luklak's `Unified Live Chat` system solves this by integrating communication directly into your workspace. The core principle is simple: **keep conversations with the work.** This ensures that all context is preserved and easily accessible in the future.

This guide covers the key tools you'll use to communicate effectively: `Space Chat`, `Object Chat`, and the `Unified Inbox`.

## The Right Channel for the Right Conversation

To keep communication organized, Luklak provides two main levels of chat within each `‚èπÔ∏è Space`. Knowing which one to use is key to effective collaboration.

  <Card title="Space Chat: Your Team's Hub" icon="message-dots" iconType="duotone">
    **Use this for:** General announcements, team-wide questions, or sharing resources relevant to everyone in the `Space`.
    <br/><br/>
    **Example:** "Hi team, just a reminder that the Q4 planning meeting is tomorrow at 10 AM."
    <br/><br/>
    **Analogy:** Think of this as the main meeting room or announcement board for the entire project.

  <Card title="Object Chat: Hyper-Focused Discussion" icon="comment-lines" iconType="duotone">
    **Use this for:** Any conversation about a **single, specific** `üßä Object`.
    <br/><br/>
    **Example:** On a task `Object` named "Design New Logo," you might comment, "@Alice can you send me the latest vector file?"
    <br/><br/>
    **Analogy:** This is a dedicated meeting about one topic. The entire conversation history is permanently attached to that work item.

## Notifying Colleagues with `@mentions`

Whether you are in `Space Chat` or `Object Chat`, the best way to get a specific person's attention is to use an `@mention`.

Simply type the `@` symbol followed by their name. The mentioned user will receive a direct notification, and the message will be highlighted for them in their `Unified Inbox`. This ensures your message is seen by the right person without spamming everyone else.

## Staying on Top of Everything: The Unified Inbox

How do you keep track of all these conversations happening across different `Spaces` and `Objects`? The answer is your `Unified Inbox`.

The `Unified Inbox` is your personal communication command center. Instead of you having to check dozens of places, it automatically collects and organizes every conversation where you were `@mentioned` and every important update on `Objects` you are assigned to or following. It turns a potentially chaotic stream of information into a single, actionable list.
