**Universal Automation in Action: A Conceptual Workflow**

This guide provides a high-level overview of a complete lead-to-project workflow powered by Universal Automation. For a detailed, interactive walkthrough of each step, please refer to the accompanying Guidejar tutorial.

**Why This Matters**

Disconnected apps create operational friction, leading to manual work and lost context. Universal Automation eliminates these silos, creating a single source of truth that allows your teams to operate with unprecedented speed and intelligence.

**The Big Picture**

This entire workflow is powered by the `🧊 Universal Object`. Because every piece of information—a customer, a contract, a site survey—is a type of `🧊 Object`, they can interact and trigger workflows across different `⏹️ Spaces` (departments) natively, without complex integrations.

**From Ad Click to Assigned Lead**

A new lead from a marketing campaign automatically creates and assigns a new customer `🧊 Object` in the Sales `⏹️ Space`.

  Capture lead source, form data, and other critical information automatically. By routing leads to the right person based on pre-set rules, your sales team can act immediately with full context.

**Frictionless Scheduling**

A single click from the `🧊 Object` triggers an action that creates and sends a Google Calendar invite to all stakeholders.

<Tip>
Embed key actions directly into your `🧊 Objects` to keep your teams focused. This eliminates the need to switch between apps for common tasks like scheduling, reducing friction and saving time.
</Tip>

**The Trigger Effect: Status-Driven Automation**

Changing the `🧊 Object` status to "Contract Prep" automatically creates two new, linked `🧊 Objects` for the Site Survey and Finance teams.

<Info>
Use `🧊 Object` statuses as powerful automation triggers. As work progresses from one stage to the next, the system can automatically engage the right teams and create the necessary tasks, ensuring a seamless handoff every time.

**Real-Time Field Intelligence**

A Site Surveyor scans a QR code to update the project `🧊 Object` with live photos and data directly from the field.

<Card title="Bridging Physical & Digital Worlds">
  Connect on-site reality to your digital workflow. QR codes linked to `🧊 Objects` allow field teams to capture and share crucial information instantly, ensuring that planners, designers, and finance are working with the most up-to-date data.

**Automated Contracting & Payments**

A one-click action generates a contract from a template, pulling all data from the `🧊 Object` and creating three payment `🧊 Sub-Objects`.

<Card title="Single Source of Truth">
  Generate documents directly from the `🧊 Object` to guarantee accuracy and consistency. Any updates made to the `🧊 Object` data will be reflected in all subsequent automated actions and communications.
</Card>

**Event-Driven Workflows**

A successful customer payment triggers a powerful cascade of automations: sending notifications, updating financials, and creating the master Project `🧊 Object`.

<Note>
Any event can be a trigger, not just a status change. Use incoming webhooks, payments, or form submissions to kick off complex, cross-functional processes automatically.
</Note>

**Automated Review Cycles & Communication**

Status changes are used to manage an internal review cycle, and another action triggers personalized, data-rich emails to the client using smart values.

<Tip>
Use smart values from any connected `🧊 Object` to create highly personalized, automated communications. This allows you to maintain a personal touch with clients at scale, without manual effort.
</Tip>

**Automating the Full Customer Lifecycle**

Completing the Project `🧊 Object` kicks off the after-sales process, creating a loyalty voucher and a recurring `🧊 Object` for Customer Success.

<Card title="Beyond Project Delivery">
  True automation covers the entire customer lifecycle. Use project completion as a trigger to automate follow-ups, schedule check-ins, and nurture the customer relationship long after the initial delivery.
