This guide provides a high-level overview of a fully automated workflow at LAIKA DESIGN. It highlights the key automation principles that connect every department into a single, fluid operating system.

## **Trap of silos**

<Info>
  In most companies, value gets trapped between disconnected apps. This operational friction leads to manual data entry, lost context, and costly delays. Universal Automation eliminates these silos, creating a single source of truth that allows your teams to operate with unprecedented speed and intelligence.
</Info>

## **The answer: Luklak Universal Automation**

<Tip>
  This entire automation series is powered by Luklak's core architecture. Every piece of information—a customer, a contract, a site survey—is a version of the `🧊 Universal Object`. Because they share the same fundamental DNA, they can interact and trigger automation across different `⏹️ Spaces` (departments) natively.

### **A Customer Journey Without Friction**

<Accordion title="From Ad Click to Assigned Lead" icon="sparkles">
  The journey begins when a prospect, **Sarah**, submits an inquiry form from a **Maddy**'s marketing ad.

  <Card title="Automated Lead Capture & Routing">
    An ad click is instantly converted into a fully contextualized `🧊 Customer` in the Sales `⏹️ Space` and automatically assigned to the right salesperson, **David**, based on pre-set rules.
  </Card>
  ### **Frictionless Scheduling**

  A custom action button in the `🧊 Customer` triggers an automated calendar invitation to all stakeholders: the client **Sarah**, **David** from Sales, and **Max** the Designer.

  <Tip>
    This eliminates the back-and-forth of scheduling and ensures every stakeholder has the right context and meeting link without ever leaving Luklak.
  </Tip>
  ### **The Trigger Effect: One Action, Multiple Workflows**

  A single status change from "Consultation" to "Contract Prep" by **David** on the `🧊 Customer` kicks off two parallel workflows simultaneously.

  <Info>
    - **Workflow 1:** A `🧊 Site Survey` is created and assigned to **Tony** in the field.
    - **Workflow 2:** A `🧊 Contract` is created and assigned to **Emma** in Accounting.
  </Info>
  ### **Real-Time Field Intelligence**

  <Card title="Connecting Field Operations to Central Command">
    On-site, **Tony** scans a QR code to open the `🧊 Site Survey` on his phone. He documents a structural issue with a live photo, creating a `🧊︎ Constraint`. This real-time data instantly notifies **Max** (Designer) and **Emma** (Accounting) so they can proactively adjust plans and pricing.
  </Card>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Collaborative, Automated Contracting" icon="sparkles">
  The `🧊 Contract` becomes the single source of truth for generating legal documents.

  <Tip>
    With one click, a Google Docs contract is generated from a template. The system uses "smart values" to pull all data directly from the `🧊 Contract`, ensuring accuracy and eliminating manual entry.
  </Tip>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="The Payment That Launches a Project" icon="sparkles">
  <Card title="Payment as a Workflow Catalyst">
    A single deposit payment from **Sarah** triggers a massive chain reaction across the entire platform:

    - A "Payment Received\!" notification is sent to the Sales chat.
    - The `🧊︎ Payment` is marked as "Paid."
    - The remaining debt on the `🧊 Contract` is automatically recalculated.
    - The master `🧊 Project` is created, officially kicking off all design and build work.
  </Card>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Seamless Design & Review Cycles" icon="sparkles">
  <Info>
    Status changes on the `🧊 Design` trigger automated communication. The system automatically tags **David** for internal review and, with one click, sends a highly personalized email to the client, **Sarah**, pulling design links and details directly from the `🧊 Design`.
  </Info>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="From Project Completion to Customer for Life" icon="sparkles">
  <Card title="Automating Long-Term Value">
    Changing the final project status to "Complete" triggers the after-care workflow. The system automatically calculates a loyalty voucher for **Sarah** and creates a new `🧊 After-Sales Care` for **Grace**, scheduling recurring check-ins to nurture the customer relationship.
  </Card>
</Accordion>

## **The Logic Behind It: A principle you already understand**

The seamless handoffs in this 7-department journey aren't custom code; they are simple, powerful rules built on a "Trigger -\> Condition -\> Action" principle. Here’s how the "Sales to Design" automation is constructed logically inside Luklak.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="1. The Trigger (The 'If')" icon="bolt" iconType="duotone">
    Every automation begins with a **Trigger**—a specific event that Luklak listens for. In our example, the trigger is: 'When an Object is updated'. Specifically, when the 'Status' field of any `🧊 Deal Object` changes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. The Condition (The 'Only When')" icon="filter" iconType="duotone">
    The **Condition** adds precision, ensuring the automation only runs when certain criteria are met. Here, the condition is: 'The new status is Closed Won'. This prevents the rule from firing for any other status change.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. The Action (The 'Then')" icon="wand-magic-sparkles" iconType="duotone">
    The **Action** is what the automation does. The action is declarative: 'Create a new `🧊︎ Design Concept Sub-Object`, connect it to the trigger `Project`, and assign it to the Design `⏹️ Space`.'
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  This **"Trigger -\> Condition -\> Action"** model is universal across the platform. By combining these simple parts, you can map and automate your most complex business processes without writing a single line of code.
</Tip>

## **The Universal Secret: How This Is All Possible**

This seamless flow isn't magic—it's a fundamental architectural advantage. Traditional software creates disconnected "islands" of data and then relies on fragile, third-party "bridges" (integrations) to connect them. Luklak is built on a unified foundation from the ground up.

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="The Universal Object" icon="cube" iconType="duotone">
    Everything in Luklak—a sales lead, a project task, a customer invoice—is a version of the same foundational LEGO piece: the `🧊 Object`. This shared DNA means every department's data speaks the same native language.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Object Connection" icon="link" iconType="duotone">
    Because everything is an `🧊 Object`, any `Object` can be natively linked to any other. There's no need to build a 'bridge' between your CRM and your project tool, because the relationship is part of the core platform fabric.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Universal Automation" icon="robot" iconType="duotone">
    This is the platform's central nervous system. It can listen for events and trigger actions on any `🧊 Object`, in any `⏹️ Space`, across the entire organization. It's not an add-on; it's the engine that drives the unified workflow.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  One system, one language, one logic. The result is zero friction and a truly scalable operating system for your business.
