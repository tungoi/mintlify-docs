This guide provides a high-level overview of a fully automated workflow at LAIKA DESIGN. It highlights the key automation principles that connect every department into a single, fluid operating system.

**Why This Matters**

<Info>
  In most companies, value gets trapped between disconnected apps. This operational friction leads to manual data entry, lost context, and costly delays. Universal Automation eliminates these silos, creating a single source of truth that allows your teams to operate with unprecedented speed and intelligence.
</Info>

**The Big Picture**

<Tip>
  This entire workflow is powered by Luklak's core architecture. Every piece of information—a customer, a contract, a site survey—is a version of the `🧊 Universal Object`. Because they share the same fundamental DNA, they can interact and trigger workflows across different `⏹️ Spaces` (departments) natively.
</Tip>

## **From Ad Click to Assigned Lead**

The journey begins when a prospect, **Sarah**, submits an inquiry form from a **Maddy**'s marketing ad.

<Card title="Automated Lead Capture & Routing">
  An ad click is instantly converted into a fully contextualized `🧊 Customer` in the Sales `⏹️ Space` and automatically assigned to the right salesperson, **David**, based on pre-set rules.
</Card>

### **Frictionless Scheduling**

A custom action button in the `🧊 Customer` triggers an automated calendar invitation to all stakeholders: the client **Sarah**, **David** from Sales, and **Max** the Designer.

<Tip>
  This eliminates the back-and-forth of scheduling and ensures every stakeholder has the right context and meeting link without ever leaving Luklak.
</Tip>

### **The Trigger Effect: One Action, Multiple Workflows**

A single status change from "Consultation" to "Contract Prep" by **David** on the `🧊 Customer` kicks off two parallel workflows simultaneously.

<Info>
  - **Workflow 1:** A `🧊 Site Survey` is created and assigned to **Tony** in the field.
  - **Workflow 2:** A `🧊 Contract` is created and assigned to **Emma** in Accounting.
</Info>

### **Real-Time Field Intelligence**

<Card title="Connecting Field Operations to Central Command">
  On-site, **Tony** scans a QR code to open the `🧊 Site Survey` on his phone. He documents a structural issue with a live photo, creating a `🧊︎ Constraint`. This real-time data instantly notifies **Max** (Designer) and **Emma** (Accounting) so they can proactively adjust plans and pricing.
</Card>

## **Collaborative, Automated Contracting**

The `🧊 Contract` becomes the single source of truth for generating legal documents.

<Tip>
  With one click, a Google Docs contract is generated from a template. The system uses "smart values" to pull all data directly from the `🧊 Contract`, ensuring accuracy and eliminating manual entry.
</Tip>

## **The Payment That Launches a Project**

<Card title="Payment as a Workflow Catalyst">
  A single deposit payment from **Sarah** triggers a massive chain reaction across the entire platform:

  - A "Payment Received\!" notification is sent to the Sales chat.
  - The `🧊︎ Payment` is marked as "Paid."
  - The remaining debt on the `🧊 Contract` is automatically recalculated.
  - The master `🧊 Project` is created, officially kicking off all design and build work.
</Card>

## **Seamless Design & Review Cycles**

<Info>
  Status changes on the `🧊 Design` trigger automated communication. The system automatically tags **David** for internal review and, with one click, sends a highly personalized email to the client, **Sarah**, pulling design links and details directly from the `🧊 Design`.
</Info>

## **From Project Completion to Customer for Life**

<Card title="Automating Long-Term Value">
  Changing the final project status to "Complete" triggers the after-care workflow. The system automatically calculates a loyalty voucher for **Sarah** and creates a new `🧊 After-Sales Care` for **Grace**, scheduling recurring check-ins to nurture the customer relationship.
</Card>
