# Case Study: How LAIKA Eliminated Silos with Universal Automation

> This article breaks down how a modern business, LAIKA, transformed its operations by connecting every department‚Äîfrom Marketing to Finance to Construction‚Äîinto a single, seamless value stream using Luklak's Universal Automation. Discover the architectural principles that make this possible.

**Why This Matters**

For executives, the greatest obstacle to growth isn't market competition‚Äîit's internal friction. When your Marketing, Sales, Accounting, and Operations teams all use different software, you create invisible walls, or "silos." Critical customer data gets lost, handoffs are manual and error-prone, and you have zero visibility into your true return on investment. Luklak's Universal Automation solves this at its core by creating a single, unified operating system for your entire business, turning a fragmented process into a high-speed, frictionless value flow.

**The Big Picture: The Trap of Silos**

Traditionally, businesses add new apps for new problems. A CRM for sales, a project manager for operations, a separate tool for finance. While each tool may be good at its job, the business pays a huge price: data fragmentation.

Valuable customer insights captured by the sales team never reach the design team. Financial data is disconnected from project milestones. This forces teams to rely on manual exports, spreadsheets, and endless meetings just to stay aligned. The result is operational drag, poor customer experiences, and slow decision-making.

**The Solution: A Single, Unified Foundation**

Luklak's Universal Automation isn't another integration tool that simply glues separate systems together. It's a fundamental shift. Because every `üìã Function` in Luklak is built from the same 7 Universal Components (like `üßä Universal Object` and `Object Connection`), they inherently "speak the same language."

The automation engine isn't a patch; it's the central nervous system of the platform. It can see and connect any data point or process, in any `‚èπÔ∏è Space`, without needing complex APIs or third-party connectors. This allows you to design end-to-end workflows that mirror how your business actually creates value.

**See It In Action: LAIKA's Seamless Customer Journey**

Let's follow a single customer at LAIKA to see how value flows frictionlessly across five different departments without any manual data entry.

1.  **Marketing ‚Üí Sales**: A customer fills out a form on a landing page. A webhook instantly creates a `üßä Customer` Object inside the `Sales & CRM` `‚èπÔ∏è Space`. Universal Automation immediately runs a rule that connects this new `üßä Customer` to the specific `Marketing/üßä Ad` that generated it. **Result**: The sales team gets the lead, and the marketing team gets perfect ROI tracking.

2.  **Sales ‚Üí Accounting & Design**: The sales rep qualifies the lead and moves the `üßä Customer` status to "Contract Prep." This single status change triggers a powerful automation. The system automatically creates two new, linked `üßä Objects` in completely different `‚èπÔ∏è Spaces`:
    * A `Contract` in the `Contracts & Invoices` `‚èπÔ∏è Space` for the finance team.
    * A `Site Survey` in the `Design & Construction` `‚èπÔ∏è Space` for the technical team.
    **Result**: Three departments are now working on the same customer, with perfect context, zero manual handoff, and no data re-entry.

3.  **Accounting ‚Üí Sales**: When the finance team updates the `Invoice` status to "PAID" in their `‚èπÔ∏è Space`, an automation sends a message back to the `Sales & CRM` `‚èπÔ∏è Space` chat, notifying the original sales rep that the deposit is secured.

4.  **Project Management ‚Üí Sales**: Months later, when the final `Project` is marked "COMPLETE" in the `Project Management` `‚èπÔ∏è Space`, a final automation runs. It calculates a loyalty discount and updates a `Voucher` field on the original `üßä Customer` Object back in the `Sales & CRM` `‚èπÔ∏è Space`. **Result**: The customer lifecycle is fully automated, from initial lead to future loyalty.

**The Universal Advantage: Unified Data & Insights**

Because every step of this journey happens on one platform, LAIKA's management gets something impossible with siloed tools: a single, universal dashboard.

They can track the conversion funnel from ad spend to signed contract, monitor project profitability in real-time, and analyze sales rep performance against actual project outcomes. The data is always live, always accurate, and requires no manual consolidation. This is the power of a truly unified system.

**Goodbye Silos, Hello Frictionless Value Flow**

LAIKA's story demonstrates that scaling a business doesn't have to mean increasing complexity. By building their operations on Luklak's unified foundation, they created a system where departments are collaborators, not islands. Data flows freely, processes are automated end-to-end, and the entire company moves faster and smarter.
